				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_271568" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271568 size-full" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Zhu-Jinshi_Elder-Feng.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="567" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Zhu-Jinshi_Elder-Feng-203x180.jpg 203w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Zhu-Jinshi_Elder-Feng.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Zhu Jinshi, &#8220;Elder Feng&#8221; (2005), oil on canvas, 63 x 70 7/8 inches (all images via <a href="http://www.blumandpoe.com/exhibitions/zhu-jinshi-0">blumandpoe.com</a>)</p></div>
<p>A precocious youth forced to work in a factory during the Cultural Revolution, the painter Zhu Jinshi afterwards joined the seminal new art group the Stars (星星), producing works that dabbled in the imported medium of abstraction. Eager to explore Western-style modernism, he moved to Berlin in 1985, only to discover that his work was actually decades behind the times.</p>
<p>However, after spending 20 years in Berlin, he returned to Beijing and continued his practice without becoming an international sensation or a symbol of “Chinese-ness.”</p>
<p>I don’t mean to undercut claims that Zhu Jinshi might make for his own work, as he titles many of his paintings somewhat allegorically, such as “Hunger” (2012) and “Power and Country 2” (2012). That said, the associative leaps needed to make those connections would also, in the end, undercut the work; after all, “Chinese content” is as much of a construction as anything else in art. To approach Zhu Jinshi’s paintings with the expectation that they are abstractions with Chinese “characteristics” is to look for the work of an exemplar first, and that of an artist second.</p>
<p>The works in the artist’s current <a href="http://www.blumandpoe.com/exhibitions/zhu-jinshi-0" target="_blank">solo exhibition</a> at Blum &amp; Poe on the Upper East Side can be compared to the abstractions of Robert Motherwell or Richard Diebenkorn, though they sometimes play with semi-abstraction, as in the face appearing out of a swirl of blue and red paint in “Elder Feng” (2015). There are also two sculptural pieces, “Bank” (2013), a landscape-like mound of golden yellow oil paint, and the Donald Judd-indebted “Nine Levels” (2015), a modular work consisting of nine boxy floor pieces.</p>
<p>In many of these works, references are made to historical and political experience, but if they appear to go for a too-easy symbolism (the golden “Bank” sculpture, for example), the artist seems less concerned with expressing concepts than with manipulating difficult forms, pushing content to a secondary position (including, again, any political or so-called “Chinese” qualities that might inhabit the works).</p>
<div id="attachment_271567" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271567 size-full" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Zhu-Jinshi_Power-and-Country-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="719" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Zhu-Jinshi_Power-and-Country-2-160x180.jpg 160w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Zhu-Jinshi_Power-and-Country-2.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Zhu Jinshi, &#8220;Power and Country 2&#8221; (2012), oil on canvas, 70 7/8 x 63 inches</p></div>
<p>If the works themselves can be viewed as “minor,” in that they don’t loudly announce an agenda, are their formal qualities muddied or compromised by their relationship to allegory or, more importantly, to themselves? For example, if we assume the context of “Power and Country 2” has something (however vaguely) to do with the Chinese state apparatus, while its paint extends outward from of the canvas, twisting and cracking at various angles, is it then our responsibility to extract the relationship between the supposed “content” of the title and the (completely abstract) painting? Can they can be de-coupled from each other?</p>
<p>Tellingly, one can never actually even see all of the painting at one time, since the frontal view actually obscures the effects of its heavy impasto (rendered undetectable in photographic reproductions), which at points reaches several inches in depth, curving over colors underneath, and on close inspection reveals a high-gloss finish on its underside.</p>
<p>As such, it’s tempting to say that there is no feature of the painting that is foregrounded, apparent to the viewer in a way that will significantly orient the work. Claims for a broad inclusion into “Chinese art” are subverted by similarities to Western painters; any homage to a Western style is undercut by allegorical readings and historical context; a formalist approach is undercut by Western and Chinese precedents; any declaration that “what you see is what you see,” to quote Frank Stella, is undermined by the human eye, which can’t, of course, see the sculptural impasto of these works simultaneously from different angles. Even an assessment, like this one, can only offer summary descriptions and raise questions, which are what these works, in my mind, appear to be working against.</p>
<p>Some larger questions that come out of this are: What is left of the paintings if they resist sense-making and positive description? Do they in fact opine little about context — political or even art-historical — and remain mercurial, temporal facts of their own materials? Are they, because of the focus on their materiality, apolitical artworks that sidestep the issues taken on by such contemporaries as Ai Weiwei or He Yunchang?</p>
<div id="attachment_271569" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271569 size-full" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Zhu-Jinshi_Hunger.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="715" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Zhu-Jinshi_Hunger-161x180.jpg 161w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Zhu-Jinshi_Hunger.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Zhu Jinshi, &#8220;Hunger 2942&#8221; (2012), oil on canvas, 70 7/8 x 63 inches</p></div>
<p>Indeed, many of the works in this exhibition “say something” only if the viewer coordinates dissimilar facets of the work — paintings that, due to their physical makeup, do not reveal themselves completely at any one time. The sculptural quality of many of the paintings (although, notably, not all) renders multiple views necessary, and parts of the works are thereby hidden from the eye and consequently the intellect. This is hardly the first exhibition of a Chinese artist to function in such a way. Nevertheless, apart from art circles relatively unknown outside of China, it’s notable. Not mired in theatrics or heroics, the works in the exhibition push the viewer into a sort of compromise, in which all aspects of the work, including its various contexts, are either simultaneously willed to the fore, or picked out as exemplary of one thing or another.</p>
<p>In either case, it is this kind of compromised vision which may, surprisingly, tie Zhu Jinshi to the overtly political artists of his generation — informed by multiple traditions, with the artworks and viewers displaced from their customary positions. As much as democracy is meant to resist a single, uniform vision, Zhu Jinshi’s works exist together with the artist, his context, and the viewer — asking for dialogue instead of totality.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_271544" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271544" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1950-Contact-Sheet-EK-w-EK-618192021-s-forlano.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="934" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1950-Contact-Sheet-EK-w-EK-618192021-s-forlano-768x1121.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1950-Contact-Sheet-EK-w-EK-618192021-s-forlano-702x1024.jpg 702w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1950-Contact-Sheet-EK-w-EK-618192021-s-forlano.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sante Forlano, &#8220;Ellsworth Kelly with reliefs, Paris&#8221; (1950) (all photos © Ellsworth Kelly.

<p>When art world luminary Ellsworth Kelly died in December at the age of 92, his obituaries described him as an artist who rejected the very idea of art as self-expression. Now a new study by scholar Yve-Alain Bois takes this idea one step further and argues that Kelly’s avowed muse was “impersonality” and the “eradication of subjectivity.”</p>
<p>Kelly’s death coincided with the Cahiers d’Art publication of <a href="http://www.cahiersdart.com/books/kelly-cr"><em>Ellsworth Kelly:</em> </a><em><a href="http://www.cahiersdart.com/books/kelly-cr">Catalogue Raisonné of Paintings, Reliefs, and Sculpture, Volume One, 1940–1953</a>.</em> In November, the catalogue was awarded the inaugural Pierre Daix Prize at the Musée Picasso in Paris. Given Kelly’s major indebtedness to 20th-century French art, the award ceremony’s location was fitting.</p>
<p>The compendium’s hefty price tag — €337.5 — places it out of reach for most practitioners and scholars who could gain from its complex insights about art-making and the evolution of a unique vision. Through Yve-Alain Bois’s engaging and painstakingly researched essays, the catalogue details each juncture in the artist’s early career. Before the reader’s eyes, Kelly is transforming himself from a middle-of-the road figurative painter into an innovative, lyrical abstractionist gradually branching out into mixed media works and relief sculptures.</p>
<div id="attachment_271547" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-B-5.jpg"><img class="wp-image-271547" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-B-5.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="465" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-B-5-124x180.jpg 124w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-B-5-768x1116.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-B-5-705x1024.jpg 705w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-B-5.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ellsworth Kelly, &#8220;Self-portrait with Thorn&#8221; (1947), oil on masonite, 36 x 24 x 1 1/2 inches, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Gift of the artist (photo by Katherine Du Tiel, courtesy SFMOMA) (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>Born in 1923 in the Newburgh suburb of New York and raised in New Jersey, Kelly served in the US Army’s 603rd Engineers battalion out of Maryland, making camouflage and decoys before he participated in battlefield operations in 1944 in Normandy, Northern France and Belgium. Back home, under the GI Bill, he studied art at Pratt Institute from 1941 to 1943 and at the Boston Museum School from 1946 to 1948.</p>
<p>In addition to its copious biographical details — Bois consulted regularly with Kelly — the catalogue offers reproductions of rarely seen student works — extensive drawings and studies along with somber portraits and moody landscapes enlivened with European avant-garde conceits; Paul Gauguin and Max Beckmann are named as foundational influences.</p>
<p>Bois’s analyses of Kelly’s art school realism emphasizes how these naively naturalistic works portend the stripped-down semi-abstractions that were soon to come. After taking in the book’s entirety, the lucky reader will be tempted, as I was, to go back to these student works and seek covert abstract effects underpinning the representational elements.</p>
<div id="attachment_271548" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271548" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-B-14.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="1040" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-B-14-768x1247.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-B-14-630x1024.jpg 630w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-B-14.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ellsworth Kelly, &#8220;Doorway&#8221; (1947), oil on canvas, 36 1/8 x 22 1/8 inches (photo by Jerry L.

<p>For instance, in the bucolic landscape “Grain Elevator, Oradell” (1940), a telephone pole, leaning on a diagonal, dominates the center of the picture, conspicuously dividing the grain elevator’s deep red façade, which is symmetrically placed at an angle to the viewer. Unadorned grayish windows on opposing sides of the elevator shaft come off as distinctly gnomic formations, while the naively painted green landscape and cloud-filled blue sky seem partitioned into neat grids.</p>
<p>Such student work won Kelly the enduring support of his teacher Karl Zerbe, a European-trained painter who had fled Nazi Germany. But not everyone was a fan of the young artist. According to Bois, when Kelly was on a student trip to France, he tried to enroll in Fernand Léger<em>’</em>s academy, an attempt that was aborted when his “Self Portrait with Bugle” (1947) was harshly critiqued. Léger<em>,</em> one of Kelly’s beloved heroes, recommended that the young man “go back to Boston and blow his bugle.”</p>
<p>With Zerbe’s encouragement, the artist indeed went back to Boston and carried on, eventually earning admission to the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris on the merits of a series of thickset, Picasso-esque nudes (1947–48).</p>
<p>Kelly’s final painting before leaving for France was the Van Gogh-homage, “Shoes” (1948), in which drab footwear, strewn hither and thither, coalesce into accidental harmony. One of his last purely realist works, “Shoes” prefigures the way Kelly would go on to pair chance operations with an assured selectivity. That dualistic approach would become Kelly’s blueprint.</p>
<p>Once settled in France, Kelly visited the studios of Hans Arp, Constantin Brancusi and Georges Vantongerloo. One of his most accomplished monochromatic paintings, “Tableau Vert” (1952) was made after a trip to Giverny, where Claude Monet’s stepson, Jean-Pierre Hoschedé, showed the young American fifteen enormous paintings that remained in the late Impressionist’s dilapidated studio.</p>
<p>While such experiences with 19th- and 20th-century art can be seen as highlights of the five years he spent in France, Kelly sought inspiration far beyond French painting. Romanesque architecture was an immediate passion. At the Bibliothèque Byzantine he studied books on Turkish art and architecture. Of special interest were the Hagia Sophia mosaics, which inspired such portraits as “Figure with Yellow and Blue” (1949) and a breakthrough series of feminized self-portraits using flattening effects, exaggerated volume and strong coloration. His academic realism was giving way to a poeticized vision. Bois refers to the work inspired by the mosaics as “oblique” lineation that traces “inner contours,” no longer conforming to naturalism.</p>
<div id="attachment_271550" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271550" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-A.1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="852" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-A.1-768x1022.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-A.1-769x1024.jpg 769w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-A.1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ellsworth Kelly, &#8220;Byzantine Head I&#8221; (1948), oil on canvas, 15 x 15 inches (photo by Ron Amstutz, courtesy Ellsworth Kelly Archives)</p></div>
<p>Kelly was similarly drawn to Chinese calligraphic sources. In the Musée Cernuschi, he examined Zhuan-Shu seals. In response, he copied their calligraphic patterns as objectively as possible. Explaining his method to Bois, Kelly was adamant that by copying a found object’s structural patterns, he would introduce no original content into his artwork. Bois describes Kelly’s “non-compositional” practice as one in which graphic transcription retains “a close link between the pattern [of the found object] that is recorded and the record itself [Kelly’s drawing of the object’s pattern].”</p>
<p>For instance, working with non-Western models such as the Zhuan-Shu seals, Kelly transcribed their calligraphic patterns in careful drawings and then used that “transcription” as the basis for an original painting — one that, like certain Chinese characters, would resemble a figure or another anthropomorphic entity that, in Kelly’s words, is presented in the artwork as “caught in the process of becoming abstract” (85).</p>
<p>Through this procedure, which Bois frequently if sometimes confusingly calls Kelly’s “transfer” technique, the artist created such imaginative works as the haunting oil painting “Faceless Head” (1949), in which the sitter’s lower body is reduced to a slender half-torso dressed in a coal-colored shirt. This disproportionately slender body gives way to an overlong neck and a large oval head whose eyes are barely rendered. “Faceless Head” locates reality in the subject’s substructure, deriving its tension from the juxtaposition of the blood-red background against the thick outlines and fleshly glow of the elongated head. By doing so, the painting focuses exclusively on the symmetry of its subject’s physiognomy. The human body emerges like an alphabetic arrangement and a semi-abstract totem.</p>
<p>Kelly’s newfound appetite for this kind of semi-abstract portraiture leads him to such open-ended, biomorphic pictures as “Study for Plant” (1949). The flower is positioned like a human head surrounded by elongated leaves resembling arms, while the bottommost leaves evoke human feet.</p>
<p>With each passing year, the young artist further blurs the boundary between abstraction and figuration.</p>
<div id="attachment_271552" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271552" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-A.22.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="798" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-A.22-768x957.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-A.22-822x1024.jpg 822w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EK-A.22.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ellsworth Kelly, &#8220;Plant II&#8221; (1949), oil on wood, 16 1/2 x 13 inches (photo by Jerry L. Thompson, courtesy Matthew Marks Gallery)</p></div>
<p>Kelly had been introduced to the surrealist technique of automatic drawing and the game of <em>cadavre exquis</em> (“exquisite corpse”) by his close friend Ralph Coburn. “Ubu” (1949), a sleek and mesmerizing oil painting, is based on random scribbles Kelly had made on his own thigh. The “non-compositional” generation of “Ubu” leads Bois to provide another explanation of Kelly’s so-called “transfer” process.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to “Ubu,” he writes, Kelly had “absent-mindedly” doodled lines on his thigh. He subsequently copied those scrawls exactly as they appeared on his skin, and then redrew a large-scale version of them on bicolored cardboard, which resulted in the painting depicting the flat face and compact body of a barn owl.</p>
<p>After this experiment with the doodles on his thigh, Kelly developed a fascination with authentically “transcribing” the designs and structural essences of other random, found objects: the fronds and lamina of seaweed; the shell of a bombed-out bunker; a sundial on a rooftop; a monstrance from an illuminated manuscript; the fretwork of window frames.</p>
<p>Dividing his time between Paris and a studio in Belle-Île, where reproductions of works by Pierre Bonnard, Paul Klee, and Pablo Picasso were tacked on his wall, Kelly produced a stunning variety of works, from extensive studies and drawings to mixed media paintings and small-scale relief sculptures. Kelly had found his calling and never looked back.</p>

<p>The new art flowed but everyday struggles persisted. Although he enjoyed a one-man show at Galerie Arnaud in 1951, his work wasn’t selling. Nearly broke, Kelly secured a job under the Marshall Plan, working as a janitor in a Paris office. By the time he resettled in America in the early summer of 1954, he had accrued a large body of original work and had progressed into the striking color panel paintings that soon made him famous. He had developed his art happily oblivious to the new movement known as Abstract Expressionism rocking the New York scene.</p>
<p>His aesthetic philosophy resonates throughout this important catalogue. Kelly learns how to view natural formations and urban structures as readymade objects to be seen, not as subjects to be described. In this renewed relation to objects, seeing is contiguous with making. “Everywhere I looked, everything I saw became something to be made,” Kelly explained, “and it had to be made exactly as it was.” In another essay in the catalogue, Kelly’s longtime partner Jack Shear, summing up Kelly’s belief in seeing and making as simultaneous, writes, “If you turn off the mind and look only with the eyes ultimately everything becomes abstract.”</p>
<p>And seeing, like art-making, was not considered by Kelly to be a totalizing act. Late in life he spoke of art in almost ontological terms: “What I’ve tried to capture is the reality of flux, to keep art an open, incomplete situation, to get at the rapture of seeing.”</p>
<p>Standing before one of Kelly’s abstract, multipanel paintings or his stark monumental public sculptures, the viewer might well ask where such resolutely formal work comes from. The literal answer lies somewhere in the particulars of the world Kelly inhabited. But those sources are necessarily displaced, gone. And now, the maker is gone, too. That leaves the artwork as Kelly’s only world, really. Seeing it, we might grasp that what Kelly <em>made</em> was, strictly, what he <em>saw</em>.</p>

<p>Jonathan Lasker’s approach to painting hasn&#8217;t changed materially in decades, and so why would his work, which struck me as an alienating (if not irritating) closed system when I first started looking at it in the 1990s, now feel so open, urgent, and fresh?</p>
<p>Lasker’s <a href="http://www.cheimread.com/exhibitions/jonathan-lasker" target="_blank">new show</a> at Cheim &amp; Read, his first since 2007, presents his usual couplings of dissimilar elements, which boil down to thickly painted blobs against thinly painted lines. Check that: there are two large works, “Democratic Beauty” and “The Remnant of Spirit” (both 2015), that eliminate the lines entirely under trowels of oil paint. But that can’t be the only reason this show feels different.</p>
<p>From the start of his career, Lasker has steadfastly explored what he describes in his essay “After Abstraction” (1986) as “discursive, rather than monotopical” painting. He declares that abstraction was &#8220;finished&#8221; when Frank Stella made his <em>Black Paintings</em>: &#8220;The goal of modern painting, which represented nothing but its own pure form, had been attained.”</p>
<p>In the essay&#8217;s concluding paragraph, he describes his attempt to create a new kind of discourse within his paintings:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is towards this end that I have painted unhappy marriages of the biomorphic and the decorative, the mark of the “loaded brush” and the geometric, the psyche and popular culture. I want a painting that’s operative. I’m seeking subject matter, not abstraction.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s fitting that he chose “unhappy” as an adjective, because his juxtapositions of opposites remained cold and distant, no matter how much their forms aspired to real-world metaphors. Whether the lines were zigzagged, scribbled or ruled, or the acres of impasto were plopped, smeared or stroked, his compositions conveyed a willful arbitrariness — randomly determined exercises in which one gesture seemed just as good as another.</p>
<p>So what, you may ask, is wrong with that? Nothing, I suppose, except that the resulting disjunctions propelled the paintings in their own orbit. Despite Lasker’s avowed goal of swapping pure abstraction for discursive subject matter, his works seemed stamped with a cerebral gamesmanship, purposefully steering clear of an emotional connection with the viewer.</p>
<p>I am reluctant to write that, with this new show, Lasker has established that connection, because that would presume it hasn’t been there all along. It would be more measured to state that his idiosyncratic vision has emerged from behind my own aesthetic blind spot.</p>
<div id="attachment_272029" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-272029" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/truth.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="492" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/truth-234x180.jpg 234w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/truth-768x591.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/truth.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Jonathan Lasker, “Trust over Truth” (2015), oil on canvas board, 12 x 16 inches</p></div>
<p>Whatever the reason, Lasker’s customary exuberance with paint, especially in those chunky passages where he presses it into ridges and vents, speaks with a bracing eloquence. The recurrent motifs, whether a cruciform, a squiggle, or a blob evoking a head and neck, create a narrative trail from painting to painting that underscores the unity of Lasker’s thinking and the exhilarating thingness of each work.</p>
<p>(The cruciform, which appears in several works, is not, as Raphael Rubinstein notes in his catalogue essay, code for &#8220;the artist&#8217;s religious conversion,&#8221; despite titles like &#8220;The Remnant of Spirit&#8221; and &#8220;The Plus Sign at Golgotha&#8221; (2014), but rather a shape that &#8220;emerged more or less unbidden as Lasker played with chopping up one of his recurring motifs, the grid.&#8221;)</p>
<p>In one small work in oil on canvas board, “Trust over Truth” (2015), two horizontal bands, one powder blue, the other mossy green, open up a depth of space unseen in any of the other paintings. The rest of the surface, which includes a two-tone cruciform, is covered mostly with variously colored scribbled lines, in contrast to the all-impasto “Remnant of Spirit,” mentioned above, whose composition is almost identical.</p>
<p>The visual fields in the latter, larger painting, however, remain entirely on or above the surface — thick swaths of powder blue, cadmium yellow, raw sienna and moss green over a flat, mottled expanse of pink and gray. In a departure from Lasker’s usual practice, there is a sooty-gray, (anatomically) heart-shaped silhouette thinly worked into the middle of the pink-gray field (a similar gesture occurs in “Democratic Beauty”). Along with the elimination of line, this flatly-painted shape may signal to longtime watchers of Lasker’s work that a new avenue of investigation has potentially been opened.</p>
<p>For the paint-hungry eye, “Democratic Beauty” and “The Remnant of Spirit” are the most satisfying works in the show, but the uniformity of their surfaces eliminate the discordant factor in the artist’s discourse, which produces, if not a softening effect, then a very different viewing experience — a less fractious yet thoroughly recognizable Lasker.</p>
<div id="attachment_272026" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-272026" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/remnant.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="476" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/remnant-242x180.jpg 242w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/remnant-768x571.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/remnant.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Jonathan Lasker, “The Remnant of Spirit” (2015), oil on linen, 75 x 100 inches</p></div>
<p>“The End of Relevance,” which, like the two all-impasto works, was done in 2015 (it would be intriguing to learn where the completion of the three paintings fell chronologically), is the most optically dazzling work in the show: composed of wobbly black lines over a pale blue field, with a mass of black scribbles dominating the right half and two black-outlined blobs of yellow paint in the lower left quadrant, the visual buzz set off by the close proximity of the lines messes with your eyes and brain. Look at it, and almost immediately the entire surface starts to quaver, as if heat waves were rippling off a bonfire on the floor.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. The wobbly lines are both vertical and horizontal, with the verticals forming two planes that converge on the center as if receding in single-point perspective, but they never meet. The rest of the field is taken up with horizontal lines whose insistent flatness resists a perspectival reading of the picture plane, much like Jack Tworkov’s planar abstractions of the 1970s. This creates a furious surface tension capped off by the graphic snap of the black-bordered slabs of yellow paint.</p>
<p>Times change, perceptions change. The “unhappy marriages” in Lasker’s paintings evince a nonchalance toward irresolvable conflict, a posture that I initially viewed as a form of resignation, an intimation that contemporary art cannot hope to achieve synthesis without succumbing to nostalgia.</p>
<p>Now, with cultural and civic life unraveling at an alarming rate, the premeditated lack of harmony among his heterogenous elements feels more like a form of acceptance, an accommodation to reality that’s required simply to go on.</p>

<p>The tension between design and art derives from the utility ascribed to the former vying with the elusiveness that characterizes the latter. In terms of the art market, to the extent that we praise those works that seem effortless, we’re actually siding with the logic of commodity. Wherever the history of the labor that goes into an object’s making is concealed, this creates a false freedom like that of the bourgeois market. Against this would be works that showcase a history. Such works won’t openly exhibit the process that went into shaping them as “art,” but they will preserve the historicity of the objects that compose them. They won’t exist as products, but they will incorporate products into their appearances, highlighting their status as productions.</p>
<div id="attachment_272104" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15936.jpg"><img class="wp-image-272104" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15936.jpg" alt="Lizzi Bougatsos, &quot;I Just Want To Be Wonderful&quot; (2016), steel, fabric, and fan, 84 x 85 x 168 in" width="320" height="247" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15936-233x180.jpg 233w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15936-768x594.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15936-1024x792.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15936.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lizzi Bougatsos, &#8220;I Just Want To Be Wonderful&#8221; (2016), steel, fabric, and fan, 84 x 85 x 168 in (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>The title of <a href="http://jamesfuentes.com/artists/bougatsos/index.php" target="_blank">Lizzi Bougatsos</a>&#8216;s show at <a href="http://jamesfuentes.com/" target="_blank">James Fuentes Gallery</a>, <a href="http://jamesfuentes.com/exhibitions/2016/current" target="_blank"><em>Work Habits</em></a>, calls attention to the invisible labor that goes into making art. The works emphasize the material underpinning of objects that have been produced for a specific use. Without being reductive, a leather jacket becomes simply leather (“After the Pope Party,” 2016); and without altering the integrity of its design, a floor fan becomes simply portable, billowing out a draped white fabric affixed to two upright steel poles (“I Just Want To Be Wonderful,” 2016). The artistry here neither conceals the labor that goes into making the work, nor does it fixate on activity and process. It creates a backdrop you can wrap around yourself like a blanket. The enveloping character of this work hinges on participation, on physical involvement. The tactility of “I Just Want To Be Wonderful” is just as important as its shifting appearance to as you move around it.</p>
<p>Like a détournement of <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/82618/james-turrell-the-natural-and-the-artificial/" target="_blank">James Turrell</a>, another piece in <em>Work Habits</em> — “Unforgettable” (2015) — drenches the gallery in deep, red light. Red, of course, is coded, and perhaps a little too obviously so — with associations like sensuality, passion, anger, and danger — but Bougatsos&#8217;s ceiling installation seems to be a dig at conceptualist dematerialization. The enveloping red light acts like an adhesive, perceptibly altering the way the other works in the show are taken in, and recasting everything to appear furtively animate and makeshift.</p>
<div id="attachment_272102" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-272102" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15926.jpg" alt="Lizzi Bougatsos, &quot;After the Pope Party&quot; (2016), wood, leather, rope, foam, polyester, yoga mat, and neon light, 32 x 72 x 26.5 in" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15926-240x180.jpg 240w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15926-768x576.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15926-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15926.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lizzi Bougatsos, &#8220;After the Pope Party&#8221; (2016), wood, leather, rope, foam, polyester, yoga mat, and neon light, 32 x 72 x 26.5 in</p></div>
<p>Bougatsos’s works are less objects than collections of objects. “After the Pope Party,” which features a leather jacket casually placed on an indiscernible object (something like a wooden chair), takes on an exploded, not quite Surrealist aspect. Each compositional element (including the yoga mat that serves as a pedestal) is arranged so that its ordinary function, while still materially present to the eye, falls away in the act of recognition. In this particular work, the leather jacket stood out to me. I wasn’t sure whether someone had just left it there, or if it even was a jacket. It didn’t seem to have a place, as jackets normally do on a table or rack, and felt alien from any notion of ownership. If it was intended as commentary, this would be commentary on fashion.</p>
<p>But what is fashion? Mingling the capacity of art to amplify a single shape or perspective exponentially with design’s instrumental character, fashion can liberate us from the ideological snares imposed by art, realizing functional structures that ideology would deem impossible. Marcel Duchamp suggested as much when he explored the readymade in the early 20th century and, like a distant echo of his “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.H.O.O.Q." target="_blank">L.H.O.O.Q.</a>” (1919), Bougatsos’s humorous print “Working Class Bird” (2016) features an appropriated photo of a pigeon perched on a ledge high atop the Empire State Building. The only modification of the original image is a cigarette inserted into the bird’s beak.</p>
<div id="attachment_272103" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-272103" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15931.jpg" alt="Lizzi Bougatsos, Working Class Bird&quot; (2016), inkjet digital print on paper, 27 x 38 x 1 in" width="640" height="474" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15931-243x180.jpg 243w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15931-768x568.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15931-1024x758.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lizzi-bougatsos-james-fuentes-15931.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lizzi Bougatsos, Working Class Bird&#8221; (2016), inkjet digital print on paper, 27 x 38 x 1 in</p></div>
<p>What came into focus for me upon viewing “Working Class Bird” was the sense of perspective it yielded — or, rather, the lack of perspective. The whole picture creates a scenario that speaks to a kind of mock heroic elegance. The cigarette stabbed into the pigeon’s mouth looks all the more real for its effusive unreality. Foregrounded against the expanse of New York, Bougatsos’s tough-guy pigeon would insouciantly reduce the city to a toy. Simultaneously, the architectural structure of Manhattan is preserved, despite the impression that it’s merely Lego blocks for the pigeon’s proletarian diversion. What would otherwise be a work of sentimental realism has become urbanely grounded by the flourish of a cigarette.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s not inaccurate to call Bougatsos’s artistry Duchampian. Brandishing the utility of objects already made, she redesigns them in accordance with her own work habits. Out of this, a new distribution of experience is produced, one which downplays the evanescence of the product in favor of the person handling it.</p>

<p>Hastily photoshopping a graphic of an airplane into a shot of some abstracted architecture could win you a Nikon prize.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nikon Singapore posted an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nikonsingapore/photos/a.168788309841996.46849.164385193615641/945585702162249/" target="_blank">announcement</a> on its Facebook page congratulating a photographer named Chay Yu Wei for his perfectly timed shot of an airplane flying above a ladder in Chinatown.</p>
<p>“Yu Wei chanced upon a set of ladders while on a photowalk with his friends in Chinatown, and thought the view above would make an interesting perspective,” Nikon wrote. “Little did he expect to catch an airplane in mid-air. We’ll try looking up too, Yu Wei.” This lucky shot won Yu Wei a Nikon trolley bag.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t long, however, before internet commenters pointed out that the plane had been shoddily pasted in. As PetaPixel <a href="http://petapixel.com/2016/01/29/nikon-awards-prize-to-badly-shopped-photo-hilarity-ensues/" target="_blank">pointed out</a>, you don&#8217;t have to look too closely to see a white blob surrounding the plane&#8217;s silhouette that&#8217;s mismatched from the sky, and changing the photo&#8217;s levels makes the copy-and-paste job ridiculously clear. Photographers had plenty to say about the matter. Many tried their hand at photoshopping Yu Wei&#8217;s ladder image, replacing the plane with everything from Godzilla to a bride (and leaving their creations in the comments on the Nikon Facebook post).</p>

<p>Of course, this isn&#8217;t the first time an award-winning photograph has been proven to be doctored or staged. In 2010, the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/20/wolf-wildlife-photographer-award-stripped" target="_blank">Natural History Museum&#8217;s wildlife photographer of the year was stripped</a> of his nearly $15,000 prize after judges discovered he&#8217;d brought in a tame Iberian wolf to stage his shot of a species rarely found in the wild. Last year, the jury of the prestigious World Press Photo contest stripped an Italian photographer of a first prize after his photograph of his cousin having sex in the back of a car at night turned out to have been staged. And the godfather of all staged photographs might be Robert Capa&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falling_Soldier" target="_blank">Falling Soldier</a>&#8221; (1936). While a trolley bag isn&#8217;t quite on the same level as these prizes, our lucky Yu Wei is carrying on a long and storied tradition.</p>
<p>Nikon Singapore has not yet removed its Facebook post congratulating Yu Wei on his Photoshopped work. In the meantime, watch out for Minecraft planes overhead.</p>

<p><em>Art Movements is a weekly collection of news, developments, and stirrings in the art world.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/25/jeremy-deller-flies-flag-thomas-more-utopia-500-years-later" target="_blank">Jeremy Deller and Fraser Muggeridge</a> unveiled their jointly designed smiley face flag atop Somerset House in London. The flag was designed to mark <em><a href="http://utopia.somersethouse.org.uk/" target="_blank">UTOPIA 2016: A Year of Imagination and Possibility</a></em>, a series of exhibitions and events celebrating the 500th anniversary of the publication of Thomas More&#8217;s novel <em>Utopia</em>.</p>
<p>John Elderfield and Gretchen Diebenkorn testified at the opening of the <a href="http://www.artnews.com/2016/01/27/at-knoedler-forgery-trial-lawyer-teaches-abstract-expressionism-and-john-elderfield-takes-the-stand/" target="_blank">Knoedler Gallery forgery trial</a>. Elderfield, the chief curator emeritus of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, testified that he had doubts regarding the authenticity of a group of Richard Diebenkorn paintings exhibited at the gallery in 1994. “I didn’t come flat out and say these were fakes, because you have to rely on more than first impressions,” Elderfield stated. Richard Diebenkorn&#8217;s daughter, Gretchen, told the court that she had expressed doubts about the authenticity of the works to the gallery&#8217;s director, Ann Freedman.</p>
<p>Renowned dissident artist <a href="https://tvrain.ru/articles/pavlenskogo_pereveli_v_tsentr_psihiatrii_imeni_serbskogo-402498/" target="_blank">Pyotr Pavlensky</a> was transferred from prison to a psychiatric hospital according to his partner Oksana Shalygina. Pavlensky, who is best known for nailing his scrotum to the ground in Moscow&#8217;s Red Square, is an outspoken critic of the Russian government.</p>
<p>Iranian President <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/271472/after-sculpture-censorship-fiasco-italian-officials-fail-to-uncover-the-naked-truth/" target="_blank">Hassan Rouhani</a> denied that he requested the <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/270948/italians-protect-iranian-presidents-virgin-eyes-from-nude-art-during-museum-visit/" target="_blank">covering up of nude statues</a> at Rome&#8217;s Capitoline Museums. Rouhani met with Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi as part of his tour of Europe. In Paris, a member of <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Iran/Topless-Femen-activist-hangs-from-Paris-bridge-in-anti-Rouhani-protest-443090" target="_blank">Femen</a> staged a mock hanging at the Passerelle Debilly footbridge with a banner reading &#8220;Welcome Rouhani, executioner of freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Egyptian writer <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/185963.aspx" target="_blank">Fatima Naoot</a> was fined over $2,550 and sentenced to 3 years in prison for &#8220;contempt of religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following a consultation process, Oxford University&#8217;s <a href="http://www.oriel.ox.ac.uk/content/oriel-college-statement-decision-about-rhodes-statue" target="_blank">Oriel College</a> decided not to remove its statue of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/28/cecil-rhodes-statue-will-not-be-removed--oxford-university">Cecil Rhodes</a>, despite an ongoing campaign by the Rhodes Must Fall movement.</p>
<p><a href="http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/332130/paul-bronfman-stops-giving-to-canada-college-over-pro-palestinian-mural/" target="_blank">Paul Bronfman</a>, the chairman of Pinewood Toronto Studios and William F. White International, withdrew his financial support of York University in Toronto over the display of a pro-Palestinian mural entitled &#8220;Palestinian Roots.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two pages from the <a href="http://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/getty-displays-medieval-illuminated-pages-after-legal-battle-finally-ends/" target="_blank">Zeyt&#8217;un Gospels</a>, a Medieval Armenian bible created by Toros Roslin, went on display at the J. Paul Getty Museum as part of the exhibition <em><a href="http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/globe/" target="_blank">Traversing the Globe through Illuminated Manuscripts</a></em>. A lawsuit over the ownership of the work was settled last year after the Armenian Apostolic Church claimed that the pages were looted during the Armenian Genocide.</p>

<p>Chris Marinello, the founder of the <a href="http://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/gloves-come-off-in-fight-to-run-international-database-of-stolen-works-of-art/" target="_blank">Art Recovery Group</a>, reported the Art Loss Register (ALR) to the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority. In a written complaint to the Competition Authority, Marinello — who worked for the ALR from 2006 to 2013 — accused the ALR of &#8220;abusive behavior.&#8221; Both organizations operate a commercial database of the world&#8217;s stolen and looted artworks.</p>
<p><a href="http://theartnewspaper.com/news/top-sydney-gallerist-launches-blistering-attack-on-the-art-world/" target="_blank">Evan Hughes</a>, the son of renowned art dealer Ray Hughes, unleashed a scathing critique of the art market in an interview with <em>The Art Newspaper</em>. &#8220;When we read that our great friend David McKee was closing his gallery in New York, it was almost as if we were given permission to declare that the art world had been taken over by dickheads,&#8221; he said. In the same interview, Hughes announced that he intends to run for public office as a member of the Australian Labor Party.</p>

<p>Currently available online and in print, <em>African Arts</em> focuses largely on reviews of books, exhibitions, and films, and prides itself as the leading journal in the field of arts from the African continent, having attracted a diverse audience since its start in 1967 — when &#8220;African art was hip and inexpensive,&#8221; as executive editor Leslie Ellen Jones put it in an email to Hyperallergic. Over the years, however, it has found itself facing an increasing deficit, especially as its audience shifted from collectors and general-interest readers to a crowd with academic and curatorial backgrounds.</p>
<p>Consortium publishing, Jones said, pools both financial and intellectual resources, not only easing financial stresses but expanding the journal&#8217;s perspective. The only other journal she knows of that has embraced this model is <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/dram" target="_blank">TDR/The Drama Review</a>, which also formed a consortium in 2011 after its editorial board found itself in a similar situation.</p>
<p>This endeavor will more than triple <em>African Arts</em>&#8216; number of editors, drawing editorial input from not only fellow US universities — at the University of Florida and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill — but also from an African institution: Rhodes University. The South African school will join the editorial consortium in 2016, led by Professor <a href="https://www.ru.ac.za/fineart/staff/" target="_blank">Ruth Simbao</a>, who is also involved in a program in Africa aimed to improve standards in regional academic publishing.</p>
<p>Each board will take charge of one issue per volume, but the editorial teams will still coordinate content with one another; all incoming submissions will also undergo review by every editor, which Jones notes will alleviate pressures over deadlines and also provide them with more time to focus on broader ideas.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it will catch on,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;It seems to me to be a way for universities to get a lot more bang for their publishing buck, and it also keeps publications from getting sunk by the failure of a single income source.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We retain our independence,&#8221; she added, &#8220;but we bring in new viewpoints.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picked apart and poured over by a confederacy of film-obsessed mavens with keen eyes and airtight attention spans, Stanley Kubrick’s opus </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1980) has proven remarkably fecund over its 36-year lifetime — almost inexhaustible, like a runaway dream or a repressed memory, or perhaps more appropriately,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Mystery_House" target="_blank">Winchester Mystery House</a>. Accordingly to legend, the owner of the San Jose, California, house was constantly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.winchestermysteryhouse.com/sarahwinchester.cfm">building and adding onto it</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that, by dint of all the additions, he could remain one step ahead of a prophesied looming danger and/or live forever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In much the same way that this peculiar house with an unusual backstory has become a notable tourist trap, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has begotten its own cottage industry of conspiracies. If you are familiar with the fantastical, analytical hypothesizing that has flourished around the movie, it&#8217;s most likely thanks to Rodney Ascher’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Room 237</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a documentary focused on some of the many far-out but rigorous theories that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experts have dreamt up. (For example: throughout the movie, Kubrick leaves clues to his role in faking the Apollo 11 lunar landing.)<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the handful of Kubrick connoisseurs featured in <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Room 237</span></i> is John Fell Ryan, </span><a href="http://adhoc.fm/post/john-fell-ryan-shining/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a self-described </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shining</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://adhoc.fm/post/john-fell-ryan-shining/" target="_blank"> obsessive</a> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not unlike the others in this way. Like them, he has an <a href="http://kdk12.tumblr.com/">active blog</a> and has made his share of video essays, among them <em>T</em><em>he Shining Backwards and Forwards</em>, a palindromic interpretation of the film that he created along with Akiva Saunders in 2011. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being exactly what you might imagine — </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, played backwards and forwards at the same time — the film </span><a href="http://kdk12.tumblr.com/post/4879566957/the-shining-forwards-and-backwards" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was conceived with just a hint of knowing humor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, taking </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.mstrmnd.com/log/802" target="_blank">a single line from an essay by fellow obsessive MSTRMND</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as its cue: </span></p>
<blockquote><p>The Shining is a film meant to be watched both forwards and backwards.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its heart of hearts, <i>The Shining Backwards and Forwards</i> is an earnest attempt to uncover more concealed secrets within the film, just one more vantage point from which to peer into the movie’s abyss. Think of it as going to the </span><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/98313/some-wheres-rainbow-pink-floyd-and-dorothy-land-in-bushwick/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark Side of the Rainbow</span></a> (or other <a href="http://www.syncmovies.com/othersyncs.html#atreyu" target="_blank">movie-music syncs</a>) <span style="font-weight: 400;">with a really open mind. Even for a naysayer, <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/kubricks-shining-letters-overlapping-redrums-and-dull-boys" target="_blank">the results</a> <a href="http://kdk12.tumblr.com/post/4879566957/the-shining-forwards-and-backwards" target="_blank">are</a> amusing and occasionally intriguing. But that’s not where the story ends.</span></p>
<div class="embed-vimeo" style="text-align:center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/68188810" width="635" height="357" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Making one more trip through the looking glass, <a href="http://www.screenslate.com/about#jon" target="_blank">Jon Dieringer</a> has stood on the shoulders of Ryan and Sanders and added 3D to the mix, resulting in <i>The Shining Backwards and Forwards and Inwards and Outwards in High Definition Anaglyph 3D (Chaos Mix) </i>(ITSBAFIHDA3D[CM]),<i> </i>currently<i> </i>enjoying a run at Spectacle Theatre <a href="http://www.spectacletheater.com/best-of-best-of-spectacle/#shining" target="_blank">through January 30</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, it is not to be taken seriously. And yet &#8230;</span></p>
<p>The experience is spectral and meta and good fun, as the film hovers over itself at self-conscious, critical remove while also engaging in a ghostly conversation with itself. Or, as <a href="http://www.screenslate.com/whats-showing-today/saturday-july-27" target="_blank">Dieringer writes</a>, 3D “[places] it in a sort of dialogue with itself as a ghost story that appears to drift over itself as a kind of apparition.” Like its previous incarnation, <em>ITSBAFIHDA3D(CM)</em> is a spirited lark of a movie self-mash-up. So when Jack Nicholson&#8217;s Jack Torrance declares, in response to a disclaimer that a past caretaker of the hotel he will soon oversee killed his entire family and then himself, “rest assured, it won’t happen to me,” and the image overlaying it shows his terrible deeds to come, there is a mixed sense of <em>ah</em> and <em>hm</em> — the <em>hm</em> felt more strongly. <a href="http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lk4w1bqaQb1qi4nyc.jpg" target="_blank">Another synchronicity</a> finds the title shot of the words “Closing Day” overlaid with Jack’s famous axing down of one of the hotel&#8217;s door. One more offers a convergence of Jack&#8217;s wife (Shelley Duvall) and a bat and Jack&#8217;s head — which she and the bat might at some point strike.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By chance, in the same week that I saw <em>ITSBAFIHDA3D(CM)</em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also viewed Annie Dorsen&#8217;s </span><a href="http://www.ps122.org/yesterday-tomorrow/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.ps122.org/yesterday-tomorrow/" target="_blank"><em> Tomorrow</em></a>, co-presented by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">La MaMa and PS122</span>. Working with computer algorithms, or conducted by them, the performance’s three human singers moved through the Beatles’ “Yesterday” into <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s “Tomorrow.” This was achieved by repeatedly singing “Yesterday” — over and over, to the point of comedy — and as they did, those algorithms gradually morphed the song, slipping in bits and pieces of “Tomorrow” with each repetition, until that’s all it was. But who&#8217;s making the choices — the humans or the algorithms? In short, here was another self-conscious, tech-aided passage through pop culture’s inner workings, an intriguing offer to look inside. They&#8217;re not completely the same, though.<i>Yesterday</i><em> Tomorrow </em>is ironically all about this time, the passing of the present. By contrast, <em>TSBAFIHDA3D(CM) </em>is Einsteinian, concerned with time itself and the uncanny interweaving of it with space.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/138810308" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>In either case, the works seem to say a lot about ourselves. It&#8217;s fun to ponder the <a style="font-weight: 400;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker_analogy">watchmaker</a>, the creator and its/their intent, especially as their mechanisms are expanded and reconstructed — or deconstructed — like in the <i style="font-weight: 400;">Chaos Mix</i> and <i style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday</span></i><em> Tomorrow. </em>This seems to especially be the case for former,<em style="font-weight: 400;"> </em>so tied to obsession. But by plunging still further down the rabbit hole, <em style="font-weight: 400;">ITSBAFIHDA3D(CM)</em> actually calls attention to this tendency to sink into our pop culture fascinations. As Dieringer <a href="http://www.screenslate.com/whats-showing-today/saturday-july-27" target="_blank">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lastly, because this HD 3D re-remix further exploits and fetishizes the possibilities of home video technologies and nods to commercial exploitation of re-modeled/re-packaged legacy titles &#8230; it feels like a video game to me — so the full title was selected to evoke Super Street Figher II Turbo HD Remix.</p></blockquote>
<p>More often than not it’s our responses (especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia" target="_blank">to randomness</a>) that are really the interesting thing. Technology enables us to undertake all sorts of pop culture psychoanalysis. Are we in control of what of what we see and hear and know? Or do algorithms do that for us? How deep is too deep for our loves and obsessions?<em> </em>What do you <a href="http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lk4vclA7be1qi4nyc.jpg" target="_blank">see here</a>?<em> </em>The powerful allure of pop culture can be perilous and illuminating, often at the same time. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or m</span></span>aybe I’m reading too much into all this.</p>

<p>In October 2015 the <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54413be4e4b0e6f12d4a82f4/t/560b3cc2e4b016db196ee246/1443577026007/Sugar+Hill+Children%27s+Museum+-+Release.pdf" target="_blank">first children’s museum in Harlem</a> opened its doors. <a href="http://www.sugarhillmuseum.org/" target="_blank">The Sugar Hill Museum of Art &amp; Storytelling</a> occupies the first and lower floors of a stunning building, designed by David Adjaye. The building also houses 191,000 square feet of affordable housing and has been praised as a model for mixed income and mixed-use development in New York City.</p>
<p>The museum inaugurated the opening with several exhibitions, each curated with children in mind, but by no means pandering or dumbing down the artistic mission. The most ambitious of the exhibitions is <em><a href="http://www.sugarhillmuseum.org/new-page/" target="_blank">Txt: art, language, media</a></em>, a mixed-media show exploring the inclusion of text in the work of 12 contemporary artists.  The show has been co-curated by Rocío Aranda-Alvarado from El Museo del Barrio and Lauren Kelley, associate director and head of curatorial programs at the museum.</p>
<p>First, I must applaud the curatorial team for having the vision to paint one wall of the exhibition a stunning brilliant pink. I love it when curators forgo the neutral “box” of the traditional gallery model and incorporate the architecture of the room into the installation. Make no mistake, this is not a “kiddie” pink; this is a shade of pink that has real balls. The pieces that are shown on the wall have a visual pop that delights the eye.</p>
<div id="attachment_271949" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/6.-Type-City-detail.jpg"><img class="wp-image-271949" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/6.-Type-City-detail.jpg" alt="6.

<p>With an emphasis on local artists, the exhibition explores the nature of “conversation” — the kind a viewer can have with an artwork — and how its very definition can change across media. I found the most successful pieces in the show to be ones that used “old media” sculpture, like drawing and objects, rather than some of the “new media” works (two of which weren’t working when I visited, an endemic problem of tech-reliant artwork).</p>
<p>Korean-born, New York-based <a href="http://www.hongseonjang.com/" target="_blank">Hong Seon Jang</a>, for instance, has created a three-dimensional portrait of New York City out of pieces of letterpress type. The type is widely varying in height, font, and size. Entitled “Type City” (2015), it’s clearly a riff on the famous “Panorama of the City of New York” that resides at the Queens Museum (a scale miniature model of the city that was commissioned for the 1964 World’s Fair).  The use of metal type is clever, as it renders buildings into abstract objects, identifiable letters, and pure texture.  A triad that is delightful to look at and an insightful representation of our city.</p>
<p>Brooklyn native <a href="http://www.ivivaolenick.com/" target="_blank">Iviva Olenick</a> is represented by 15 framed drawings, hung together like a puzzle in a single block. “Post-It/ Tweets; Selfies and Lettergrams” portrays the artist’s life as seen through social media. Embroidered lines of text reveal tidbits of chat, gathered from her personal social media conversations. The embroideries are then incorporated into loose watercolor paintings that compose a portrait of the person (or persons) whom the artist is having a conversation with. Containing poetic hints about the relationships between Olenick and her friends and family members, and strangers, the drawings memorialize her online interactions.</p>
<div id="attachment_271946" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271946" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/3.-LKelley-Olnickto-use.jpg" alt="3.-LKelley-Olnickto use" width="640" height="361" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/3.-LKelley-Olnickto-use-291x164.jpg 291w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/3.-LKelley-Olnickto-use-768x433.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/3.-LKelley-Olnickto-use-1024x577.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/3.-LKelley-Olnickto-use.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Installation view of Iviva Olenick&#8217;s “Post-It/ Tweets; Selfies and Lettergrams” (2014–2015) (detail)</p></div>
<p>The boldest statement in the exhibition is a made by <a href="http://antoniaaperezstudio.com/home.html" target="_blank">Antonia Perez</a>. She has crocheted a large rug out of plastic bags. Embedded in the colorful and decorative patterns of the rug is the message, “Estas En Tu Casa” (which is also the title of the piece). Interestingly, when I looked this up for translation online I was offered an interesting variation of formal and colloquial meanings. From “Make Yourself at Home” to “You are at Home” to the literal “Are you at Home.” They all work, in subtle ways, in the context of the artwork. A rug made of cast-off bags with this message leads to interesting questions (and remember this is a show pitched for children): Is this a comment on homelessness? The ways in which we make a home for ourselves? Is it a comment on the environment and the waste all around us? The wall title doesn’t give any hints, but I see it as a jumping-off point for conversation. As an aside, the rug is beautiful, a geometric patchwork of strong colors and linear design.</p>

<p>The inclusion of Vuk Ćosić in this show is an interesting addition. Ćosić has been credited with the invention of “net.art,” a digital platform that elevated the use of basic pixels and basic computer code (0’s and 1’s) to an art form. An early proponent of computer code as art, he mixes political, social, and aesthetic commentary into pixilated, mesmerizing videos. In the video included in this show, “Bruce Lee, King Kong, Mickey Mouse, Singing in the Rain” (2009), he has edited the films together into an amusing mash-up of cultural icons, all hierarchies erased by reducing all images to “0” or “1.” The visual text is seamlessly united with the very essence of computer language.</p>
<p>It’s a rich show, full of unexpected artworks that all circle around a common theme. But the show could have easily been larger. There are so many artists working with the theme of “text” that I would have loved to have seen this show expand into a fuller representation of that theme. However, this ambitious exhibit harbors the promise that future shows will continue to redefine “children’s art” and challenge our notions of what children have the patience and interest to look at. This is an exhibition approachable by those of all ages, and marks a auspicious start for a new Harlem arts institution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_271892" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271892" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/word-image-41-cropped.jpg" alt="Race and ethnicity staff percentages (all images via Diversity in the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs Community, courtesy Department of Cultural Affairs)" width="640" height="326" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/word-image-41-cropped-291x148.jpg 291w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/word-image-41-cropped-768x391.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/word-image-41-cropped-1024x521.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/word-image-41-cropped.jpg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Race and ethnicity staff percentages (all images via &#8220;Diversity in the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs Community&#8221; report, courtesy Department of Cultural Affairs)</p></div>
<p>This week, New York City&#8217;s <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/diversity/index.page" target="_blank">Department of Cultural Affairs</a> (DCA) <a href="http://www.sr.ithaka.org/publications/diversity-in-the-new-york-city-department-of-cultural-affairs-community/" target="_blank">released</a> a report showing that the city&#8217;s arts sector is not as diverse as the general demographics the city — the fourth most diverse municipality in the US (although still <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-diverse-cities-are-often-the-most-segregated/" target="_blank">incredibly segregated</a>). Conducted by research firm <a href="http://www.sr.ithaka.org/" target="_blank">Ithaka S+R</a> — the folks behind last August&#8217;s report on <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/226959/the-diversity-problem-at-american-museums-gets-a-report/" target="_blank">diversity in US art museums</a> — the study looks at categories including race and ethnicity, gender, and age in relation to employment statuses such as job type and job level. The researchers surveyed over 36,000 employees, volunteers, and board members from over 1,000 nonprofit cultural organizations that received DCA funding in the last three years — not only institutions focused on the visual and performing arts, but also the multi-disciplinary and the scientific.</p>
<p>Initiated last summer, the report is the <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/173120/city-initiative-will-measure-staff-and-leadership-diversity-at-new-york-museums/" target="_blank">first of its type</a> and is intended to serve as a baseline to measure progress as the DCA works to promote diversity to create a more inclusive cultural sector. While the greatest disparity between New York City&#8217;s cultural workforce and its general population lies in the representations of race and ethnicity, the report shows that the gender balance at the staff and board levels is pretty even — 53% female and 47% male — which aligns with the overall gender composition of the city. In terms of race, the staffs of DCA-funded organizations are 62% white non-Hispanic — or 17% points over the city&#8217;s overall white non-Hispanic population. Still, the cultural workforce of New York City is on the whole more diverse than its counterparts around the country.</p>
<div id="attachment_271891" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271891" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/word-image-29-cropped.jpg" alt="Gender percentage and total" width="640" height="414" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/word-image-29-cropped-278x180.jpg 278w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/word-image-29-cropped-768x497.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/word-image-29-cropped.jpg 989w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Gender percentage and total</p></div>
<p>A lot of the resulting data is unsurprising, like the fact that positions in the fields of security and facilities are largely held by mostly men and minorities — a trend the museum diversity report also reflected. On the flip side, women tend to dominate jobs involving community engagement, development, marketing, and public relations, while white non-Hispanics hold down the lion&#8217;s share of librarian, curator, and project/exhibition manager positions.</p>
<p>Things get a little more interesting when you look at organizational distribution based on the percentages of women and of white non-Hispanic staff and hone in on the extremities. According to the report, there are 27 organizations that have a 100% female staff and seven that are 100% male; the data for race and ethnicity reveals that 82 organizations are 100% white non-Hispanic, while 73 operate as entirely minority institutions — many of these, the report notes, have a specific ethnic focus.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting insights the report delivers, though, stem from the responses of individuals surveyed — most of whom are between the ages of 25 and 35, were mostly hired in the last five years, and make up the most racially diverse age group among groups that receive DCA funding. As part of the questionnaires researchers sent out, employees were asked about their perspectives on diversity in their own workforces. Of the participants, 69% responded that they either agreed or strongly agreed that their organizations were diverse; 8% disagreed or strongly disagreed, citing socioeconomic and pipeline issues as primary barriers to diversification. Still, 77% of those surveyed said they thought there were no barriers at all to increasing diversity — perhaps reflecting the very same attitudes that will make diversifying the city&#8217;s cultural sector difficult.</p>
<p>The report is a major step in the city government&#8217;s efforts to actively take a role in improving the demographics of our creative landscape. DCA is also engaging in a number of initiatives, from supporting pipeline programs created by the City University of New York and private philanthropies to funding the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcla/html/funding/institutions.shtml" target="_blank">Cultural Institutions Group</a> to support projects that directly promote diversity efforts. The DCA plans to issue an open-call for proposals with possible solutions this spring.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_268925" style="width: 595px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-268925" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_0595-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Chatterbox, 2015 " width="585" height="585" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_0595-180x180.jpg 180w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_0595-768x768.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_0595-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Liss LaFleur, &#8220;Chatterbox&#8221; (2015) (all photos courtesy of the artist)</p></div>
<p>There is a dance — an intimate choreography between what a viewer sees in an artwork and what the artist intended it to mean. Additionally, the signifier we place in front of artists who are not white males often affects<strong> </strong>the way in which they are perceived. For female artists — in particular, female queer artists — working under that label of &#8220;other&#8221; or even (heaven forfend!) being thrust into the realm of &#8220;craft&#8221; can be inhibiting, but also often the impetus needed to create their work.</p>
<div id="attachment_268927" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-268927" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/e01422_71c0923e6aac497f93dc4f0e90f2bf66-1.jpg" alt="LaFleur" width="320" height="373" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Liss LaFleur</p></div>
<p>In the case of Dallas-based artist <a href="http://www.lisslafleur.com" target="_blank">Liss LaFleur</a>, there are many layers<strong> </strong>to the meaning of her work, both personally and for the audience she is trying to reach. LaFleur&#8217;s work has evolved to evince a richness and a prismatic quality, and curators and critics are definitely taking notice: she currently has a solo exhibition at <a href="http://www.conduitgallery.com" target="_blank">Conduit Gallery</a> in Dallas and is included in a group show at the <a href="http://cicamuseum.com" target="_blank">Czong Institute for Contemporary Art</a> (CICA) in South Korea. LaFleur, an assistant professor in New Media at the College of Visual Art and Design at the University of North Texas, uses her work as an artist to influence the way she teaches her undergraduate students in the methods and application of new media. She was part of a Ford Foundation–funded initiative called <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/the-latest/ford-live-events/out-for-change-the-future-of-lgbt-rights/" target="_blank">OUT FOR CHANGE</a> at the MIT Media Lab, exploring transmedia activism, and she was named one of “10 to Watch” in 2014 by <em><a href="http://independent-magazine.org" target="_blank">Independent Magazine</a>.</em></p>
<div id="attachment_268936" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/liss-lafleur.png"><img class="wp-image-268936" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/liss-lafleur.png" alt="YOU BELONG TO ME 2015 Audio/video installation 1 projector and 5 rows of pink fringe in a wooden or steel frame suspended from the ceiling 6' x 3' x 8', 6:30 looped" width="320" height="241" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/liss-lafleur-239x180.png 239w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/liss-lafleur.png 588w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Liss LaFleur, &#8220;You Belong to Me&#8221; (2015), audio/video installation, 1 projector and 5 rows of pink fringe in a wooden or steel frame suspended from the ceiling, 6&#8242; x 3&#8242; x 8&#8242;, 6:30 looped (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>When describing herself and how she navigates both her identity and her identity as an artist, LaFleur told Hyperallergic,<strong> </strong>“I am an interdisciplinary artist who uses performance, storytelling, and technology to focus on themes of domesticity, loss, and historic parallelism. I explore political identities and personal relationships around the instability of memory and representation.” As an artist who identifies as queer, LaFleur investigates the fluidity and transformative qualities of self-reflection and self-deprecation. The role of narrative is key to her work — she instrumentalizes her body as a means of communication.</p>
<p>LaFleur’s corporeality is evident in pieces such as “You Belong To Me” (2015), in which she filmed herself in a long black wig and a form-fitting black dress, slipping into the trappings of a sexualized femme and lip-synching to the doo-wop classic of the same name. The character that LaFleur assumes is part Betti Page and part Marlene Dietrich, with a big dollop of Cher. The film is projected onto rods of hot pink fringe, hung from a wooden frame and suspended from the ceiling. It conflates the idea of gender within the genre of doo-wop and creates a layered lens<strong> </strong>through which to view the woman. She is not seen in her entirety, as portions of the projection are lost in the holes between the fringe; add to that the hyper-feminine shade that serves as the screen itself, essentially fetishizing the idea of woman, rendering her inert and only able to lip-synch or “parrot” the man who is singing.</p>
<div id="attachment_268939" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-268939" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02-LaFleur_Chatterbox-1024x576.jpg" alt="Still from &quot;Chatterbox&quot;" width="640" height="360" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02-LaFleur_Chatterbox-291x164.jpg 291w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02-LaFleur_Chatterbox-768x432.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/02-LaFleur_Chatterbox-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Still from &#8220;Chatterbox&#8221; (2015)</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Chatterbox&#8221; is comprised of a set of 3D-printed dentures worn as a prosthetic by the artist. Each tooth features a small hole, in which she inserts different charms throughout her performance, 3D-printed charms cast in silver and rendered as kitchen utensils: spoon, knife, fork, spatula, frying pan. These objects represent ideals of domesticity, the housewife, and the fetishization of female gender roles. During this assembling and dissembling of her mouth, LaFleur attempts to hum Leslie Gore&#8217;s 1962 anthem “You Don’t Own Me.&#8221; The piece is intended to be either performed live in a gallery or shown as a single-channel video, with the ephemera from the performance displayed on a black velvet tray.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chatterbox&#8221; is unsettling, jarring even — which is part of LaFleur’s goal. “I am interested in extreme acts that pull you in, as unconventional as they might be,” she explained. “&#8217;Chatterbox&#8217; was the first time I digitally fabricated an extension of my own body. This became an exaggeration of otherness, a disturbance/discomfort that I could explore both within myself and with a viewer.” In this piece, which is featured in <em><a href="http://cicamuseum.com/new-media-art-2016/" target="_blank">CICA New Media Art 2016: The 2nd International Exhibition on New Media Art</a></em>, LaFleur examines the proclivities and behaviors associated with the oral and the tenets of feminism. The piece looks at the mouth as a multifaceted environment – one capable of pleasure, communication, and pain, as well as a space for the entrance of disease and one in need of hygienic practices. In tandem with this inspection of orality and feminism is the notion of the cyborg and the introduction of technology into our physicality. With the addition of wearable technology, and even surgically implanted technology, humanity seems as though it is on a swift course toward hybridity with machines. The work was inspired by Donna Haraway’s “<a href="http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Haraway-CyborgManifesto-1.pdf" target="_blank">Cyborg Manifesto</a>,“ in which she states: “The cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our politics. The cyborg is a condensed image of both imagination and material reality, the two joined centers structuring any possibility of historical transformation.”</p>
<div id="attachment_268972" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-268972" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/e01422_8a3bdaf886fd46ee8c4d48a7020de6a3.gif" alt="QUEEN, 2015 9' x 2' x 4' Neon, motor, Dairy Queen sign " width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Queen&#8221; (2015), 9&#8242; x 2&#8242; x 4&#8242;, neon, motor, Dairy Queen sign</p></div>
<p>Diverging from performance and her use of the body as medium, LaFleur’s “Queen” (2015) looks at the reclamation of fetishized and feminized commodity. The piece starts with a decommissioned neon Dairy Queen sign, subverting its feminization by altering the reading of the word. The sign flashes from &#8220;queen&#8221; to &#8220;queer,&#8221; questioning the role of the woman in consumerism, the notion of feminine identity, and the ideologies engendered in the South. Though the artist&#8217;s body is not visible in the piece, it is still very much a self-portrait, demonstrating LaFleur&#8217;s identity and her subversion of gender roles, not only as a gay woman, but also as an artist who inspects the nature of gender, commodification, and systems of power.</p>
<p>LaFleur’s work is at once in your face and delicate, choosing a mode of seduction that uses pastiche to lure the viewer in with a hint of familiarity — then jolting them into a world that questions the status quo. “Feminism is part of a larger consciousness of oppression along with racism, ageism, classism, ableism, and sexual orientation,” LaFleur said. “If the fourth wave of feminism is a digital one, feminist art can only be understood within the intersections of suppression and in the context of the marginalization of other groups and genders.”</p>

<p>American Magnum photographer Steve McCurry, best known for his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Girl">1984 photograph of an Afghan refugee with piercing green eyes (Sharbat Gula)</a>, is one of the most celebrated photojournalists of our time. His career started in 1978, after the work of Margaret Bourke-White and Henri Cartier-Bresson inspired him to take his first visit to India. This trip, on which McCurry used up 250 rolls of Kodachrome, would be the first of his more than 80 visits to the country.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://rubinmuseum.org/events/exhibitions/steve-mccurry-india"><em>Steve McCurry: India</em></a><em>,</em> on view at the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art in partnership with the International Center of Photography, presents a selection of images from 30 years of the photojournalist’s travels across the South Asian subcontinent. They capture scenes from this land of 1.2 billion in brilliant, supersaturated colors:</span> monsoon-flooded Bengali villages; Rajasthani desert dust storms; green-painted men crowd surfing at a Holi festival; Hindu pilgrims visiting shrines on the River Ganges; steam engines chugging past the Taj Mahal.</p>

<p>In terms of their composition, color, and specificity of subject — an old man carrying his rusted sewing machine through floodwaters, a young girl running past a hand-painted Bollywood movie poster — these are beautiful photographs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing is, as a group, the photographs on view seem run through a particularly dreamy filter. McCurry usually isn&#8217;t one to shy away from conflict — he spent years covering the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Iran-Iraq War" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran-Iraq_War">Iran-Iraq War</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Lebanon Civil War" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon_Civil_War">Lebanon Civil War</a>, the <a title="Cambodian Civil War" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_Civil_War">Cambodian Civil War</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Islamic insurgency in the Philippines" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_insurgency_in_the_Philippines">Islamic insurgency in the Philippines</a>, <a title="Gulf War" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War">the Gulf War</a>, and the <a title="War in Afghanistan (1978–present)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(1978%E2%80%93present)">Afghan Civil War</a>, and is known for his images of AIDS victims in Vietnam. But here, the curation presents a Western visitor&#8217;s romanticized vision of India as a magical land of color, light, holiness, enlightenment, collectivism, and carefree near-nakedness. While they reflect some vibrant aspects of the subcontinent, they don&#8217;t tell the whole story. The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> selected images edit out both the more banal, less “exotic” aspects of Indian life (there are no photos of, say, Indian office workers or McDonald’s servers here) as well as its less picturesque aspects (even images of monsoon destruction resemble stills from adventure films). </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presented without much context, the images on view gloss over the country’s fraught history of colonialism. If your only knowledge of India came from these photographs, you’d never guess an Englishman had ever set foot on its shores. They ignore the massive impact of globalization on the contemporary Indian economy, as well as many of its most pressing social issues. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the show seems to cater to a fantasy-driven idea of India that appeals to Western </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ben-bowler/can-the-changing-face-of-_b_4363378.html">spiritual tourists</a>: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/george-harrison-did-he-celebrate-indian-culture-or-exploit-it-901324">India of George Harrison</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Dass">Ram Dass,</a> the India of<em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat,_Pray,_Love">Eat, Pray, Love,</a></em> the land of a thousand yoga retreats.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s not to say these photographs of awe-inspiring landscapes and holy men with saffron-colored beards won&#8217;t make you want to visit India. They probably will. Still, it&#8217;s worth questioning whether they reinforce Western stereotypes of the East instead of challenging them, and whether they only show you what you want to see. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_271381" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-271381" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/019_2WTC-BelowBoxes_Image-by-DBOX_original.jpg" alt="Rendering of 2 WTC as seen from the street (image by DBOX)" width="640" height="783" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/019_2WTC-BelowBoxes_Image-by-DBOX_original-147x180.jpg 147w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/019_2WTC-BelowBoxes_Image-by-DBOX_original-768x939.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/019_2WTC-BelowBoxes_Image-by-DBOX_original-838x1024.jpg 838w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/019_2WTC-BelowBoxes_Image-by-DBOX_original.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Rendering of 2 WTC as seen from the street (image by DBOX)</p></div>
<p>We, the quasi-entitled, live comfortably amid gut-wrenching gut renovations, tear-downs converted into luxuriant build-ups, tautological street-infrastructure projects inspired by Samuel Beckett (digging holes, filling holes, digging up the same holes again), prices through the roof, a baby boom, nanny armies, bespoke dog walkers, and other potent signs of accelerated fabulousness. More real than reality: unreal real estate in downtown Manhattan.</p>
<p>Yet we persist, undaunted by hyper-accelerated urban redevelopment — perhaps epitomized by the new Herzog &amp; de Meuron ultraluxe glass condo tower at 56 Leonard Street in east Tribeca. In concept stage, at least, their design imparted a playful structural dynamism, but now that the building is reaching completion, it seems to have been dumbed down into a run-of-the-mill North Miami Beach residential tower. Another lost opportunity? Or simply a zone- and scale-transgressing extravaganza that should never have been erected in the first place?</p>

<p>Architects, developers, and politicians invariably do the design-for-expediency trade-off tango, a dance of compromises that occasionally results in architectural miracles but more often generates cookie-cutter buildings with hotel-like amenities — and the occasional <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/30/nyc-bans-poor-doors-separate-entrances-for-low-income-tenants">poor door</a> just to rub salt in the wound — that land in our cities with the dull thud of a pallid satisfactoriness. These days, however, just a hint of innovation seems to act as a sufficient tonic to the pervasive sense of melancholy brought on by buildings of soul-crushing mediocrity. All in all, we seem to be resigned to taking what little we can get in terms of the redesigning of our city, even if this means that our sense of place is becoming displaced into an abiding sense of nonplace. Why anyone would want to spend big bucks to live in a city increasingly characterized by nonplaces — a city that may be reaching the tipping point of population density, particularly downtown — is anyone’s guess. Maybe it’s just becoming more difficult to distinguish nonplace from place?</p>
<p>Two new Manhattan projects — the tetrahedron luxury rental at 625 West 57th Street (currently under construction) and the apparently non-Euclidean stack that will be 2 WTC (in <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/213932/stacked-boxes-and-big-statements-in-new-2-world-trade-center-design/" target="_blank">concept stage</a>) — have been designed by BIG, the firm led by Dane Bjarke Ingels. Probably the hottest young architect on the scene right now, Ingels seems to be attracted to the notion that architects still have some degree of responsibility to invoke context/place, i.e., that place still has a place, so to speak, in the nonplace of our post-neomodernist cities. Skyscrapers and towers are part of the DNA of the modern metropolis — embodiments of capital and power, facilitated by trade-offs between private and public sectors, and occasional beacons of innovative, progressive design. In the second decade of the 21st century, nearly 15 years after the destruction of the World Trade Center and just months since the completion of 1 WTC — itself a passable yet uninspired tower that is a monument to design compromises and too many chefs in the master-planning kitchen — another opportunity has arisen from the ashes of that paradigm-shifting day. And like an architectural superhero (perhaps Thor’s distant cousin?), it seems as if the sky has opened up and Ingels has thunderbolted to the rescue with his design concept for 2 WTC.</p>

<p>Larry Silverstein, who controls the site, has struck an agreement with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. and 21st Century Fox, both of which will be headquartered in the lower half of the tower. Ingels replaced Norman Foster on this high-profile project, and he has been outspoken about his desire to produce a building that is deeply contextual — i.e., responsive to the memorial, to 1 WTC, to the phantom limbs of the original twin towers, and, in particular, to the historical district of Tribeca. In broad conceptual terms, the desire to allude to context and history may be salutary, yet there is also some reason for trepidation: it’s one thing for an architect to invoke the distinct scale of a low-rise historic neighborhood on the mega-scale of a high-rise office tower, but it’s quite another to imagine that an office building can actually embody the authentic neighborhood that surrounds it — and not merely the spectacular simulation of said neighborhood. Ingels suggests that the slightly off-kilter stack of rectilinear volumes will not only invoke this contextual vernacular, but that each stack element will function as a distinct, flexible ecosystem that can be tailored to the needs, uses, and programs of the client. In other words, employees will not merely labor in alienating workspaces, but will belong to a neighborhood of workers in the sky: the “lifestyle community” of corporate employment. The workplace as privileged neighborhood? Reading the Ingels design on metaphorical terms, to me it symbolizes not the potential harmonization of older human-scaled structures with newer post–human scale megastructures in our cityscape, but rather their basic irreconcilability. Of course, such disparities in scale — often brought about by peculiar zoning allowances — are increasingly in evidence throughout New York. Admittedly, when I first saw the Ingels design, it brought to mind a gargantuan, bulked-up version of SANAA’s New Museum building on the Bowery.</p>
<p>Just as Ingels would like to somehow signify early-20th-century neighborhood charm within an early-21st-century office tower, his design for Google’s new campus in Northern California attempts to engender an interpenetration of the contextual “natural” landscape and the workplace/space, producing what might become a kind of quasi-organic, biosphere-inflected <em>workscape</em>. These projects indicate the same kind of combinatory impulse: for 2 WTC, weaving together the space of work and the space of neighborhood, and for the Google campus, weaving together the space of work and the space of nature. In both instances, design is an instrument with which to blur categories and experiences, or at least to produce a persuasive simulation of this blurring. It’s one thing to introduce nature into the workspace, but quite another to displace the vernacular codes of a neighborhood into/onto an office tower — the latter creates the impression that the architect is sensitive to place, even though what’s being proposed is closer to <em>post</em>place. But since communities/residents have precious little say in what private developers and their hired architects do, we are reduced to holding our collective breaths and hoping for the best.</p>

<p>One hopes that 2 WTC will not merely become a signifier of Downtown’s final, triumphant, ecstatic financialization. Who needs authentic neighborhoods when simulated neighborhoods can be generated as/within residential and office towers? And who can distinguish between the real and the simulation at this point anyway? It almost goes without saying that a brand new simulated version of a neighborhood is sexier, and far more millennialesque, than the existing neighborhood that served as the model for the simulation. I’m being coy, dear reader, but you get the point. In the future, when I look up at 2 WTC, will I see a new, improved, <em>workspace</em> version of&#8230; the neighborhood?</p>

<p>We appear to be in the midst of an accelerated towerizing — and, in certain instances, <em>mega</em>-towerizing — of Manhattan (and Brooklyn, too). My use of the term “towerizing” is not meant to be confused in <em>any</em> way with terrorizing, of course. Although, come to think of it, it <em>is</em> a bit terrifying to consider the stratospheric prices for sky-kissing condos, and to acknowledge that such buildings evince a desire for a separate enclave of class-based living/lifestyle perched on Olympian heights, far removed from the teeming mass of mortals that make up the urban dross. This is not an entirely new phenomenon historically, yet we seem to have entered into a hyperbolic expression of this tendency, wherein floor-through palaces in the sky are the bejeweled testaments to the materialization of global capital. Think of it as Fritz Lang’s <em>Metropolis </em>on financial steroids, but, regrettably, without the highways in the sky that would in fact now be a pragmatic infrastructural response to the overcrowding of streets and sidewalks in downtown Manhattan.</p>
<p>If you build vertical towers, this produces increased urban density down at street level, yet there seems to be little thought about how to deal with this density on an everyday, lived basis. Traffic is our infrastructure, but perhaps the most bizarre example to date of this lust for mega-towers has not even been envisioned for a city, but rather within the quaint town of Vals in the Swiss Alps, where Thom Mayne/Morphosis won a hotel competition with a design featuring a mirrored, slenderized, 381-meter-tall needle-tower. The dream here, apparently, is to reach the towering heights of mountains, because that’s where gods, power, and ultra-customized hotel services dwell. Do megatowers presage the emergence of megacities? Or are megatowers a necessary element of megacities? Let’s hope this is not the future for Vals. And then we have China’s planned Jing-jin-ji megacity around Beijing, which would comprise a population of more than 130 million souls, covering an area of over 200,000 square kilometers, dwarfing a place like New York. The emergence of what might be a new kind of city-state.</p>
<p>But to get back to the point, since it is, at least ostensibly, the redevelopment of Ground Zero that we are discussing here: 13 years ago I wrote “A Strangely <em>New </em>New York: From Viewing Platform at WTC/Ground Zero to Prada Epicenter Store.” First published in the March/April 2002 issue of <em>Flash Art</em>, and subsequently revised for my 2013 book, <em><a href="http://www.artbook.com/9783037641958.html">Art Is a Problem</a>, </em>the essay offered a comparative analysis of these two new architectural-urban projects. Like many other residents of NYC, I witnessed the attacks and the collapse of the WTC towers, and I harbored conflicting thoughts about what should be done to heal the wound, so to speak:</p>
<blockquote><p>Regarding the appropriateness of the Viewing Platform, this is an issue — moral, ethical, and spiritual — that each of us has to reflect upon. Many people — on regional, national, and global levels — want to, and will, make pilgrimages to Ground Zero. The Platform does help to regulate the flow of visitors through lower Manhattan, even though its existence, paradoxically, may attract more people. At the same time, no one wants to be perceived as linking the Viewing Platform to a broader marketing campaign to revitalize New York’s tourist economy; this would be distasteful. (And what of the family members who lost loved ones in 9/11: how do we gauge their various perspectives?) New Yorkers are concerned, legitimately, about escalating voyeurism and spectacle, particularly since bodies are still being unearthed from the site. At the same time, given that live and recorded images of Ground Zero have been on television continuously for months, and that the site exists for most people as pure media event, the Viewing Platform does, at the very least, create the opportunity for another kind of experience. This is all a preamble, of course, to the public debates that will heat up regarding the actual redevelopment of the WTC site, and the design of a permanent memorial.</p></blockquote>
<p>1 WTC is currently the tallest building in the United States and the third tallest in the world; Dubai has the highest. Massive tower projects are under way in China, Russia, and elsewhere. Maybe this is just an extreme version of Le Corbusier’s dream of cities in the sky: cities in the rarefied air of the upper stratosphere. Evidence: Billionaire’s Row in and around 57th Street. For instance, Rafael Vinoly’s 432 Park Avenue supertower stretches 1,396 feet to the heavens like an elevator shaft with windows, making it the tallest residential building in NYC, visible from almost everywhere. This megastructure heralds the pending arrival of more supertowers in this urban node, unless our mayor can somehow thwart the onslaught, which seems unlikely. This is urban acupuncture taken to an absurd limit; these super-expensive needle supertowers may burst the city before the real estate bubble bursts. Perhaps one day, New York’s underclasses will all live under the shadows of the superrich’s supertowers, as in certain neighborhoods in Mumbai. How soon until we arrive at that post-cosmopolitan, dystopian future here in NYC?</p>

<p>In the Financial District, perhaps as a riposte to Frank Gehry’s “New York” torqueing rental 76-story supertower at 8 Spruce Street, a Robert A.M. Stern condo tower is going up: 30 Park Place, owned by Silverstein Properties and marketed as Four Seasons Private Residences. Here’s an excerpt from the building’s description on Stern’s website: “Sharing a city block with the Woolworth Building, Cass Gilbert&#8217;s iconic 1913 skyscraper, 30 Park Place, will combine a 189-key five-star Four Seasons hotel with 157 top-end condominium apartments in a slender 82-story tower that will become an important landmark among the constellation of towers in Manhattan&#8217;s Downtown.” Enough said? Well, perhaps just one thing to add: Although this tower is still being constructed, it already reeks of ersatz historicism and a kind of deadly (and deadening) self-importance. Worse still, it’s drab on a gargantuan scale. Taken together, the Gehry, Stern, and Herzog &amp; de Meuron towers can be understood to symbolize the transformation of lower Manhattan into an amalgamated cartography of speculative, luxury-lifestyle capital.</p>
<p>When Ingels speaks of how the scale and vernacular of downtown’s historical districts influenced his design concept for the WTC 2, we may be seduced by his desire to use the neighborhood’s DNA to grow a building that, he implies, will challenge the archetypal office tower — perhaps this is his way of acknowledging the need for preservation. Or perhaps it is his way of suggesting that the preservation of historical architecture — its language, scale, proportions, and embedded urban histories — will eventually become an anachronism, because it can be invoked or assimilated as codified vernacular, as branding device, within the form of new buildings. Is this Ingels’s way of proposing a kinder, gentler, and smarter version of postmodernism, or post-historicism?</p>
<p>A building that is a shape-shifter, that is continuously adjustable, mutable, and flexible, that can be designed to be structurally responsive to its urban environs, reshaping the city that in turn reshapes it, is a seductive fantasy. Ingels seems to be attracted to the dialectical relationship between the unitary building and the multiplicities of urban space that surround it. His architectural language suggests flexibility and organic mutability, an approach — not entirely unlike Zaha Hadid’s — that can generate pleasing visual and spatial effects, particularly in relation to the literal immutability of monumental urban edifices and megastructures. There is something magnetic, at least at the level of style and the image of the cityscape, about seemingly post-rational, post-Euclidean, sculptural architecture in the midst of assembly-line neomodernist rationality. Yet I think this is more of a spectacular theater of formal ingenuity and engineering pyrotechnics than it is a fundamental rethinking of the role of architecture and architect in our cities. Historically, and in the present, we’ve observed suggestions of movement, mutability, and urban responsiveness within aspects of designs by Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Niemeyer, Gaudi, Gehry, Libeskind, Hadid, Koolhaas, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and Mayne/Morphosis, among others. These impulses suggest a different kind of morphological life for architectural form that invokes fluidity and movement, particularly in relation to the putative rigidities of Mies van der Rohe and his high-modernist progeny (although there can be reflected movement in/on the glass curtain). Superstudio and Constant dreamt of a different kind of city beyond the rational expressions of urban capitalism, wherein megastructures would, ironically, unite urban differences while also opening up the possibility of mutable, post-capitalist city spaces, becoming a kind of negative utopia designed to consume the dystopias of rationalized, capitalist urban space. This never came to pass, of course, perhaps because real megastructures lend themselves all too easily to economic and political power. Luxury supertowers are our post-utopian megastructures.</p>

<p>But I have a sense that Ingels would like to throw a bit of a curveball at the pandemic lust for phallic needles poking at the sky. Ingels has nicknamed his West 57th Street rental building a “courtscraper,” which apparently is meant to signify the dovetailing of elements of a European courtyard building and the scale of a skyscraper. Currently under construction, the tetrahedron appears to be swept away from the West Side Highway as if by the Hudson River’s tides. The building has a kind of horizontal verticality, exuding a dynamic, neofuturistic spatial-structural elasticity that distinguishes it from the surroundings, yet also suggests a playful relationship to place. It seems to have a sense of humor about itself, which is refreshing. But I also have the impression that the building would be more comfortable on the Santa Monica beachfront than in Midtown Manhattan — though maybe that’s part of Ingels’s point.</p>
<p>The problem with innovative buildings is that they eventually become static monuments to their own architectural ingenuity, which, admittedly, is still preferable to the vast majority of buildings that memorialize their own mediocrity. It’s questionable whether New York was ever really a delirious city or an event-city on architectural and urbanistic terms, but if there is delirium today, it is the delirium of excess capital, some of which has been generated by an overheated real estate market that threatens to transform the city into a vast gated community of luxury condos and rentals. And while I suppose I prefer that someone like Ingels is the recipient of this excess capital as opposed to some hack, I’m more committed to the idea and practice that significant amounts of capital (political and economic) need to be invested into communities that are being pushed out of their neighborhoods by the forces of unrestrained gentrification and inequitable urban development. New York City needs not only more affordable housing, but an affordable urban ecosystem — and both seem to be slipping further out of reach, the current Mayor’s efforts notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Empty space, and available sky-space, have always seemed to induce <em>horror vacui</em> and kenophobia in property owners and real estate developers. After 9/11, this tendency was intensified due to the desperation to rebuild what had been lost, to fill the void, to prove that the United States would not capitulate to terrorisms. And so, after more than a decade, we have 1 WTC, a half-baked structure that reads like textbook architectural compromise. It is adequate but inelegant. It doesn’t even work particularly well on its own terms, because its terms are internally inconsistent. The most effective characteristic of 1 WTC may be its oblique allusion to the skin of the original Twin Towers. In all other respects, however, it appears to be the result of a design-by-committee process, an inert mélange of stillborn ideas, and a monument to missed opportunities. But there it is, nonetheless standing its ground, dumb and defiant, utterly humorless (despite being topped with an immense light saber) and oblivious to anything we might say about it. It’s like an architectural bully hulking at the bottom end of Manhattan. But at least there’s an observation deck.</p>
<p>Perhaps Ingels senses that something is amiss with 1 WTC, and sees 2 WTC as an opportunity to inject a bit more adventurousness into the post–Ground Zero context that had already devolved from master plan to mishmash, if only to distract us from the mundaneness of 1 WTC. Although it will be difficult to compete with Santiago Calatrava’s new transportation hub, which invokes the beautiful skeleton of a colossal extraterrestrial spaceship. My understanding of the Ingels design is that when the building is viewed from one angle, a phantom limb of one of the original WTC towers will be connoted — the continuous surface side of 2 WTC somehow mirroring 1 WTC, and the specter of the Twin Towers reconstituted, in a deft act of perceptual conjuring. From the other primary perspective, we will observe the irregular stack of boxes, ascending like a stairway to architectural and — Silverstein and Murdoch hope — financial heaven.</p>

<p>Whereas Le Corbusier wished to produce streets in the sky, Ingels appears to be trying to engender <em>neighborhoods </em>in the sky with this design. In one of his explanatory diagrams for 2 WTC, he promotes a simple formula: “Vertical Village + Modern Tower = 2 WTC.” Perhaps invoking MVRDV’s use of the vertical village concept in rethinking Asian cities, Ingels would like to fuse together the more intimate historical scales of the pre- or early modern urban village with the seemingly unstoppable mega-scales of 21st-century supermodernism into a hybrid that probably would have given Jane Jacobs heartburn, but might have been heartening to Robert Moses. On conceptual and formal terms, there is something interesting about how Ingels takes one step backward and two steps forward, while avoiding some of the worst tendencies of postmodern architecture’s kitschy, ersatz neohistoricism, yet there is nevertheless something rather generically corporatist about his 2 WTC design. Beyond alluding to local context in an obliquely codified manner, and even taking into account the sophistication of his design, wouldn’t it be nice to see Ingels engage with a wide range of NYC residents in public dialogues about 2 WTC, instead of merely paying lip service to<em> ideas</em> of neighborhood and community by producing a ginormous hypermodernist corporate simulacrum that seems to usher in the end of any traditional conditions of human-scale density, neighborhood and community? Maybe we have arrived at the cusp of post-human urban density.</p>
<p>Yet the citizens of this city are also Ingels’s clients: we have to live with the buildings too. Of course, this is a ridiculous suggestion that invokes the possibility of a dangerously democratic, egalitarian urban/architectural design process. In terms of the ethics and politics of architecture and urban development, today’s progressive architect needs to rethink the top-down, fait accompli approach and find innovative ways to constructively reach out to the multiple populations (in addition to community boards) that comprise a city, as an integral part of the design process. In other words: <em>during</em> the design process, not after it.</p>
<p>In the end, though, do we really need to fill another void at Ground Zero? And to fill it with a building that will house a conservative media conglomerate, regardless of the merits of the architectural design? Yes, some temporary construction jobs will be created, and more office space will be made available. But is this the best we can do at a moment when many in New York City are demanding a more equitable approach to urban development? An approach that deemphasizes the financial center, and instead seeks to redistribute investment capital — and political capital — to traditionally marginalized communities in ways that will not reproduce the inequitable aspects of gentrification? Maybe we should have a citywide referendum. Oh, never mind, I must be dreaming.</p>
<p>As a born and bred New Yorker, I’m still committed to this place; it’s where I’ve lived and worked most of my life, and where my parents died. But is our city still a place? Or is it a nonplace that is on the verge of becoming a postplace wherein the only space left is the space of capital? Maybe we’ve reached a tipping point, and now we need to tip back in the direction of an authentically diverse, equitable cosmopolitanism, and embrace the ethos of inhabiting a complex, shared urbanity: a just city that benefits the many, not only the few.</p>

<p>In April of 1789, a few months before the storming of the Bastille, the paper factory of Jean-Baptiste Réveillon in Paris was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9veillon_riots">taken over</a> by labor protestors, who commandeered the machines to print paper in red, white, and blue. This early act of the French Revolution is just one of the intriguing historic moments in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0500518122/hyperallergic-20">An Anthology of Decorated Papers</a></em> by P. J. M. Marks, out this month from <a href="http://www.thamesandhudsonusa.com/books/an-anthology-of-decorated-papers-a-sourcebook-for-designers-hardcover">Thames &amp; Hudson</a>.</p>

<p>A book about decorated papers doesn&#8217;t seem like it would be that compelling, but Marks, curator of bookbindings at the British Library, examines the evolution of the humble art form in the context of its time and place. The over 250 examples in the book are from the British Library&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/bookbind/olgahirsch/olgahirschcolintro.html">Olga Hirsch Collection of Decorated Papers</a>. Hirsch, who died in 1968, was a bookbinder, and much of the collection of over 3,500 papers focuses on <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/134950/the-lost-beauty-of-book-endpapers/">book endpapers</a> and other publishing ephemera. There are also wrappers, backs of playing cards, currency paper, wallpaper, musical instrument covers, and other examples of the medium, mostly dating from the 16th to 20th century.</p>
<p>Decorated papers as an art form haven&#8217;t been thoroughly researched, and being that they were often mass-produced, haven&#8217;t been traditionally of high value. Marks writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Decorated papers offer much more than a mere backdrop to the era in which they were created. There is still scope for discovery. Why did the English enthusiastically adopt marbled papers when the Scots preferred gold? Why, for that matter, did European marbling develop in such a different way from the Turkish style on which it was based? Fashion, access to materials (the astragalus plant, whose resin makes the water more viscous in Turkish marbling, is absent in Europe) and different cultural imperatives must be considered.</p></blockquote>

<p>Brocade foil papers could decorate religious books in Europe, while in China a version known as &#8220;tea chest&#8221; paper replaced the toxic lead lining that had previously been used in packaging tea. Paper could also reflect cultural value and exchange, whether paper with swallow birds in Japan installed in homes for luck, or an 18th-century German paper showing an early interpretation of a crocodile, which appears a bit like a distorted bird, with two talons on each foot.</p>
<p>Importantly, decorated papers have long been accessible, whether handmade marbling, block printing, lithography, embossing, or mass-produced decoration of the 20th century. As Marks writes: &#8220;Unlike expensive oil paintings, decorated papers were available to all but the poorest in society,&#8221; and thus reflect the popular tastes of each age.</p>

<p>When you think of representations of full-figured women throughout history, works by Rubens or Botero may immediately come to mind. Discussions of body image, however, tend to center around the portrayal of the nude. An exhibition currently at New York University&#8217;s 80WSE Gallery asks visitors to consider ideas of female beauty in relation to the sartorial, as depicted in images from the 18th century onward. <em><a href="http://beyondmeasurenyu.com" target="_blank">Beyond Measure: Fashion and the Plus-Size*</a></em>, organized by students in <a href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/art/costume/" target="_blank">NYU Steinhardt&#8217;s MA Costume Studies</a> program, explores attitudes toward women as reflected in fashion over the past four centuries through material including paintings, clothing, and videos. In addition to occupying a section of the gallery, the exhibition also exists online in the form of a web app that allows visitors to explore each object along with audio clips from curators and additional images and videos.</p>

<p>&#8220;While the subject of plus-size is prevalent in social media, blogs, and online media today, it is rarely treated within the academia and museums,&#8221; co-curator Ya&#8217;ara Keydar told Hyperallergic. &#8220;With this exhibition, we wanted to provide the plus-size woman in history the space that she seldom receives, and by doing so, start a conversation on this important subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those with sharp eyes may have noticed the asterisk tacked to the end of the exhibition&#8217;s title — it represents the debate the curators had as they organized the show, during which they realized no one term used to describe body image will ever satisfy everyone. The term &#8220;plus-size&#8221; itself actually garnered backlash last year during the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/women-note-the-minuses-of-plus-size-1427477067" target="_blank">#DropThePlus campaign</a>, but curators decided to shape the exhibition around it after researching the historical and contemporary meanings of other terms, from &#8220;curvy&#8221; to &#8220;plump&#8221; to &#8220;Rubenesque.&#8221; A note at the bottom of the exhibition&#8217;s wall text thus reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>* “Plus-size” is only one of many terms used to describe the non-thin body; after careful consideration, it was chosen by the curators for its association with the fashion industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Organized chronologically, <em>Beyond Measure</em> examines in particular the fashion industry, with its curators acknowledging it as the most powerful entity that defines our perceptions of plus-size women today. Objects on view point to various trends throughout history that highlight shifts in ideals of physical beauty. Some works, from an early-20th-century photograph of a &#8220;Nettie the Fat Girl&#8221; sideshow to a page of a 1960s clothing pattern &#8220;designed for chubbies,&#8221; nod to negative notions of heavier set women. The former highlights Nettie&#8217;s reputation as a freak or as a subject for spectacle, the latter reminds of the role of manufacturers in reinforcing labels many would consider demeaning.</p>

<p>Still, other images illustrate how the fashion world is not always ignorant of or hostile to those with fuller figures. The oldest work nods to the fact that even &#8220;240 years ago, the plus-size woman was not antithetical to fashion but seamlessly melding with it,&#8221; as Keydar said. Represented in the gallery by a facsimile (the original <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/436235" target="_blank">hangs</a> in the Metropolitan Museum of Art), a 1776 portrait painted by <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search?ft=*&amp;amp;who=Duplessis%2c+Joseph+Siffred%24Joseph+Siffred+Duplessis" target="_blank">Joseph Siffred Duplessis</a> shows a woman wearing a fashionable, laced stomacher. Although the accessory reminds of corsets that literally sculpted bodies into forms considered beautiful for being dainty, it also suggests that plus-size women could still fit in with the heralded trends of the time even if their physiques differed from the cultural ideal.</p>
<p>Similarly, a 1930s dress designed posthumously in honor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Dressler" target="_blank">Marie Dressler</a> celebrated the actress and comedienne&#8217;s larger-than-average figure, advertised to women of similar sizes as &#8220;sheer, cool, fresh, perfect fitting.&#8221; <em>Beyond Measure</em> also features more contemporary examples to show the increasingly welcoming attitudes of our time toward plus-size women even as stick-thin models continue to dominate the fashion industry. A 1992 photograph taken by Jean Paul Gaultier of Stella Ellis marks the successful entrance of plus-size women into the world of high fashion, while a video streams the winner of <em>Project Runway</em>&#8216;s most recent season, who sent a collection for plus-size women down the catwalk for her final collection.</p>
<p>Occupying 80 WSE&#8217;s project space, the exhibition is small but significant, exploring a topic that, although not new, remains relevant and worthy of a proper public platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all wanted to start a conversation on a subject that is definitely deserving the spotlight of the museological space,&#8221; Keydar said. &#8220;We hope to see more plus-size historical garments on display, for example, and the plus-size fashion more often researched within the academic and scholarly environment.&#8221;</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.bronxmuseum.org/exhibitions/transitions-new-photography-from-bangladesh" target="_blank">Transitions: New Photography from Bangladesh</a></em>, a collaboration between the <a href="http://www.bacc-nyc.org" target="_blank">Bangladeshi American Creative Collective</a> and the Bronx Museum of the Arts, offers a dark view of the forces of industrial production and globalization at work in contemporary Bangladesh. The exhibition, which includes images by nine artists living and working in the country, is not organized around a particular thesis. Instead, it features a series of themes — each photographer’s take on the contemporary moment.</p>
<div id="attachment_266317" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mojumder_saikat_08.jpg"><img class="wp-image-266317" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mojumder_saikat_08.jpg" alt="Saikat Mojumder, from Life: Born in a Slum, 2009" width="320" height="213" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mojumder_saikat_08-270x180.jpg 270w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mojumder_saikat_08-768x512.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mojumder_saikat_08.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Saikat Mojumder, from &#8216;Life: Born in a Slum&#8217; (2009) (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>Some of the images in <em>Transitions</em> fall under the (broad) stylistic umbrella of documentary photography. <a href="http://www.taslimaakhter.com/" target="_blank">Taslima Akhter</a>’s series <em>Death of a Thousand Dreams</em> chronicles the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/world/asia/bangladesh-building-collapse.html" target="_blank">2013 collapse of Rana Plaza</a>, a complex of garment factories that produced clothing for first-world markets. The prints capture the dust settling and the human toll rising. A man embraces a woman beneath the rubble; both are dead, the bright colors of their clothing muted by the debris that buries them. In another image, a family of three stands in group embrace among cold bodies beneath white sheets. Life is similarly cheap in <a href="https://mojumdersaikat.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Saikat Mojumder</a>’s 2009 series <em>Life: Born in a Slum</em>. Here birth occurs without sterilization, comfort, or convenience. In one photograph, a pregnant woman lies on a bed. In another, young children surround two small plates of rice. In a third, a baby has just been born, its umbilical cord still uncut. The juxtaposition created by these nine images shows the harshness of being born into poverty; they suggest that a poor life is a fragile one.</p>
<p>The natural world also suffers under the yoke of rapid industrialization. The wall text for <a href="http://tapashpaul.com/" target="_blank">Tapash Paul</a>’s 2015 series a<em> pause to breathe&#8230;</em> describes a zoo in Dhaka: “It is located in a tranquil landscape. … Its cages are small, dirty, and poorly maintained; conditions are inhospitable, the food supply is inadequate, and zoo-goers often throw junk food into the trash-strewn pens.” But the text continues, stating that although the zoo is essentially deficient, three million people visit every year, perhaps because city residents want to escape the overwhelming urban environment of their daily lives. Paul’s photos, however, maintain no illusions about the reality of the place: a severed rabbit head lies in the dirt, a tiger prostrates listlessly behind a concrete wall, alligators swim in a pond covered in algae. This is no pastoral paradise.</p>
<div id="attachment_266315" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_3662.jpg"><img class="wp-image-266315" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_3662.jpg" alt="Debashish Chakrabarty, Stardust, installation view, image by author " width="320" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_3662-135x180.jpg 135w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_3662-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_3662.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Debashish Chakrabarty, &#8216;Stardust&#8217; (2014), installation view at the Bronx Museum of the Arts (photo by the author for Hyperallergic) (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>Not all the photography in <em>Transitions</em> adheres to a photojournalistic framework. <a href="http://debashishchakrabarty.portfoliobox.me/" target="_blank">Debashish Chakrabarty</a>’s 2014 <em>Stardust</em> is a series of snapshots of light. Some of the light appears to be emanating from recognizable shapes — are those headphones? a toilet? — but its luminosity so totally eclipses each background that the images are endowed with an uncanny, otherworldly effect. <a href="http://www.boaatpress.com/arfun-ahmed/#arfun-ahmed-home" target="_blank">Arfun Ahmed</a>’s 2014 photograph &#8220;Olympia Burkha&#8221; bitingly inverts the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia_(Manet)" target="_blank">Manet original</a>. A woman in a hijab and limb-covering dress lies on a couch; her stare meets the viewer as directly as that of Manet’s subject. Behind her, instead of the black servant in the painting, stands a white maid, also wearing a hijab. Chakrabarty’s image playfully upends the racial, class, and gender assumptions of Manet’s work.</p>
<p>The most salient takeaway from <em>Transitions</em> is a political one: the injustice of developing economies producing goods for the developed world. While some in Bangladesh are lifted out of poverty by the process of globalization, the pollution and low working standards brought on by the increasing demand for cheap goods demonstrate how heavily the developing world bears the cost of environmental degradation. <em>Transitions</em>, while not an explicitly political exhibition, surely takes a position on the issue of <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-the-paris-climate-agreement-means-for-vulnerable-nations" target="_blank">climate change compensation</a>: developed countries that pollute should, at absolute minimum, pay to mitigate their effects.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_271612" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271612" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Swimming-still-4.jpg" alt="Swimming still 4" width="640" height="360" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Swimming-still-4-291x164.jpg 291w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Swimming-still-4-768x432.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Swimming-still-4-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Swimming-still-4.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Still of &#8220;Swimming in Your Skin Again&#8221; (2015) by Terence Nance (all images courtesy Borscht Corp. and Terence Nance)</p></div>
<p class="p1">MIAMI — There is a wordy, massive disclaimer at the beginning of director <a href="http://terencenance.com/" target="_blank">Terence Nance</a>’s recent short film, “<a href="https://www.nowness.com/story/swimming-in-your-skin-again-terence-nance" target="_blank">Swimming in Your Skin Again</a>”: “This film is not promotional, representative, or reflective of any existing religious or cultural practice,” says a woman’s voice, “including but not limited to Santería, Candomblé, Vodou, Catholicism, Christianity …” She goes on, the list stretching to include the Church of Bey and quantum mechanics, each accompanied by a sketched drawing, until she explains, “This film is sound and images juxtaposed, and means nothing.” Then we are immersed in water, out of the realm of sketches and into the juxtaposition of which our temporary narrator speaks. Though the remaining 20 minutes of the film traipses into beautiful, cosmic unknowns, none of it is meaningless.</p>
<p>Terence Nance premiered <em><a href="http://www.ofherbeauty.com/" target="_blank">An Oversimplification of Her Beauty</a></em> at Sundance in 2012, to much acclaim. The feature — a glimmering prism into the life of a man pondering the nature of relationships, time, and the ways they intersect — is told through a multitude of lenses, among them video, cartoons, and stop-motion animation. It was funny and moving and necessary, both as a reminder that young black filmmakers aren’t an emerging trend but have <em>always</em> been here, and that experimental filmmaking can be accessible, even relatable. Though Nance hasn’t yet directed another full-length, all that he’s created since, whether politically charged and pertinent (“<a href="https://vimeo.com/112982543" target="_blank">Blackout: John Burris Speaks</a>”) or idyllic (his video for Cody Chesnutt’s “<a href="https://vimeo.com/56885386" target="_blank">Till I Met Thee</a>”), toy with elements of the sublime. <em>Swimming in Your Skin Again</em>, a moving and magical realist poem, is no different.</p>
<div id="attachment_271613" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271613" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Swimming-Still-3.jpg" alt="Swimming Still 3" width="640" height="360" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Swimming-Still-3-291x164.jpg 291w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Swimming-Still-3-768x432.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Swimming-Still-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Swimming-Still-3.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Still of &#8220;Swimming in Your Skin Again&#8221; (2015) by Terence Nance</p></div>
<p>Produced by Miami film and multimedia collective <a href="http://borschtcorp.com/" target="_blank">Borscht Corp.</a>, the film was written in collaboration with Nance’s younger brother, Norvis Jr., an artist and musician whose song lyrics lent the movie its title. He is also our protagonist, if we are to pick a human protagonist rather than a thematic one (motherhood or water might be other choices). In an opening scene, we find him in yellow, typing the aforementioned song. Later, we find him in the woods, at church, underwater, often accompanied by a young girl; each person we meet along the way feels like a ghostly apparition.</p>
<p>The film itself is like a song, punctuated by dance, poetry, and the movement of the sea. Though the symbiosis between motherhood and the ocean is not immediately explicit, the symbolic connection between water and the womb, between nature and family, seems ingrained. In one scene, a group of young boys walk through a lush tropical clearing, reciting rhymes into megaphones, speaking of their birth and the cosmos. They come upon an older woman who shushes them, calls them to her, places yellow-paint handprints on their backs as a second woman in white assists. The handprints disappear as they follow her through the verdant flora, then leave the woods, wandering over fences and into the streets, alone in a new sort of wilderness. In another moment, Norvis dives into a pool as we hear a telephone conversation between a mother and her son. Both the divide between them and the mother’s unwavering love are clear: “How’s your day been?” she asks. “Fucked up, the usual.” Her reply: “That happens, too,” she says. “Then you just have to keep on moving, keep on trucking … One foot in front of the other. What’s the weather like?”</p>

<p>These days, it is hard to discuss Miami, the film’s location, without mentioning <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/261072/interactive-art-about-climate-change-in-a-city-where-it-will-wreak-havoc/" target="_blank">its potential demise</a> — another explanation for &#8220;Swimming in Your Skin Again&#8221;’s perpetual references to the sea. Says Nance:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I got there, a few people mentioned to me that the city was sinking and that it would be uninhabitable within the century. I also heard that Miami Beach, at least, was a kind of conquistador-constructed intervention into the ocean and the current situation regarding sinking is at least in part due to the fact that these urban planners came through with their hubris thinking they could beat Mother Nature. So I’m sure that kind of just got in my head when I was writing it in Miami, knowing that it was ecologically temporal.</p></blockquote>
<p>One interlude features a child dancing not just to music but also to radio clips commenting on Miami’s sad, potential dissolution.</p>
<p>There is a kind of mysticism here: we leave the womb, but remain somehow attached; pushing ourselves (and our cities) too hard and insensitively, we reenter a different kind of aquatic fate. So says our narrator to the girl beside him: “I don’t think we should go too far away from the pool … Because that’s where she lives. You know, the one who lives in the water.” “Man, she don’t live in the pool,” replies the girl. “She’s in the ocean.” Earlier, alone, she stands at the podium in a mostly empty church, and announces to us: “The child in each of us knows paradise. Paradise is home, home as it was or home as it should have been … yet each child is cast from paradise, into growth and destruction, into solitude and new community, into vast, ongoing change.”</p>

<p>We all know the intimate experience of watching something precious and deeply known to you become washed away with time, or of learning to step out of the water and make your own footprints. This might account for the film’s naturalism, its ease. Even in its dreamlike roaming, it is intuitive and connective — like breathing or like birth.</p>

<p>Among several modes enthusiastically adopted by painters in the last century, spontaneity is still held in the highest regard. Having proved durable for artists of varying ideologies and orientations, spontaneity has been transformed from a method to a value. Overworking an image, a technical misstep one assumes was as common in the past as it is today, is no longer understood as a misstep but as an insufficient appreciation of the extemporaneous. Our ubiquitous taste for color in the higher keys is also a direct result of our collective loyalty to this and to other assertive painting methods. Color is likely to be cleaner and more intense if applied in uninterrupted passes over a prepared surface.</p>
<p>These generally accepted values — intense color and spontaneous execution — defined the ground on which representational painters made peace with their abstract brethren in the early 1960s. What ties the work of <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/194330/beer-with-a-painter-lois-dodd/" target="_blank">Lois Dodd</a> and <a href="http://www.alexandregallery.com/neil-welliver/" target="_blank">Neil Welliver</a> to the period that saw the rise of <a href="http://www.kennethnoland.com/" target="_blank">Kenneth Noland</a> and <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/249710/something-worth-arguing-about-frank-stella-fills-the-whitney/" target="_blank">Frank Stella</a> is a shared bias toward directly applied and unadulterated color, and it is on this same ground that <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/112231/janet-fish-and-the-primacy-of-perception/" target="_blank">Janet Fish</a> has thrived for decades, exploring in subtle ways the boundaries of representational and abstract painting.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dcmooregallery.com/exhibitions/2016-01-07_janet-fish-glass-and-plastic-the-early-years-1968-1978" target="_blank">current exhibition</a> at <a href="http://www.dcmooregallery.com/" target="_blank">DC Moore Gallery</a> highlights a selection of Fish’s work from the late 1960s and 1970s that demonstrates how, within the limitations she had set for herself at the time, she found a surprising range of solutions to problems arising from still life arrangements in the unforgiving light of a sunny window. “Untitled (Two Packages of Pears)” (1969), for instance, one of the earliest canvases in the show, portrays six pears wrapped in a shrink-type plastic membrane taken as is from the produce section of a supermarket. It is as complex an assembly of near incongruous planes as any cubist composition of the early 20th century, yet it is built upon the artist’s affinity for things as they actually appear. Its subject fills the entire frame, distributing the images of the greenish pears among bending reflections of the artist’s studio windows. Like a <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/46074/james-rosenquist-f-111/" target="_blank">James Rosenquist</a> billboard-size canvas of similar subject matter, Fish’s easel-size canvas exploits the twisting reflections to her advantage. With deliberate brushwork she manages to create a painterly reality, effectively holding our attention to both its abstract patterns and color-saturated ordinariness. In a similar canvas, “Plantains in a Box” (1969), the high-contrast reflections on the plastic surface dominate the painting. But for the rump of a green bunch of plantains extending toward the foreground, the reflections would have compelled a totally abstract reading.</p>
<div id="attachment_271499" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271499" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/janet-fish-dc-moore-image-1.jpg" alt="Janet Fish, &quot;Plantains in a Box&quot; (1969), oil on canvas, 44 x 44 in" width="640" height="639" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/janet-fish-dc-moore-image-1-180x180.jpg 180w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/janet-fish-dc-moore-image-1-768x767.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/janet-fish-dc-moore-image-1-1024x1022.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/janet-fish-dc-moore-image-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Janet Fish, &#8220;Plantains in a Box&#8221; (1969), oil on canvas, 44 x 44 in</p></div>
<p>But it is Fish’s eye-popping color that initially draws the viewer across the gallery’s expansive floor. As you enter the space, brightly colored jars and bottles beckon for a closer look. Yet by the time you are standing at an optimal distance from any one canvas, the scale has swollen to a size that has no relation to the actual object. Jelly jars climb to a yard high, rendering their orange glow back into the reality of paint on canvas. The displacement of scale compels a viewer to accept both the illusion and the painted surface in a balance that is far more absorbing than orthodox photorealism, which strives to defeat the painterly aspect. Fish keeps our attention on both illusion and surface by maintaining a field of direct, near ascetic strokes in all of the manifestations of her style.</p>
<p>It’s surprising to see how many manifestations of a simple premise can be developed. There is one in particular, dating from the mid-&#8217;70s, that departs from the strong color found in the earlier pictures. “Five Tall Glasses, One Dawn Morning” (1975), painted in near grisaille tones with sparse hints of blue and yellow, pushes the representational to the edges of visual coherence. Much of the painting’s interest is generated by distorted traces of unseen visual sources, some of which appear to be windows, but with no corresponding images filtering through their panes. Some are so loose in character that they imply freehand invention, the effect of which is to work against a strong reading of the illusion. Yet the properties of glass and water remain palpable.</p>
<div id="attachment_271503" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/janet-fish-dc-moore-image-4.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-271503"><img class="wp-image-271503" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/janet-fish-dc-moore-image-4.jpg" alt="Janet Fish, &quot;Windex Bottles&quot; (1971–72), oil on linen, 49 3/4 x 29 3/4 in" width="320" height="536" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/janet-fish-dc-moore-image-4-768x1286.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/janet-fish-dc-moore-image-4-612x1024.jpg 612w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/janet-fish-dc-moore-image-4.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Janet Fish, &#8220;Windex Bottles&#8221; (1971–72), oil on linen, 49 3/4 x 29 3/4 in (click to elarge)</p></div>
<p>Except for the conventionally photo-realist “Windex Bottles” (1971–72), the paintings chosen for this exhibition consistently tease the viewer’s attention away from the purely mimetic and nudge it back toward the surface. In “Stuffed Peppers” (1970), an asymmetrical pattern of vertical window reflections acts as a single-axis grid, flattening the picture in spite of the carefully modelled forms stacked in each jar’s pale brine.</p>
<p>“Smucker’s Jelly” (1973), a horizontal composition of three jars, is one of the most abstract of the lot. Three jars in the foreground are set up with a finger’s width of space between them. The two strips of space that appear between the jars are then filled, in one instance with the color from a fourth jar behind the first and second, and in the other with the same light grayish hue that narrowly frames the entire image. The tapering of each jar’s elevation leaves these two spaces slightly triangular, which heightens their abstract profile. As shapes, they manage to maintain their presence against the pull of the painting’s convincing artifice, creating a vigorous dialectic between surface and pictorial depth. More than any other aspect of this show, this dialectic reveals Fish to be more than a painter of pleasant still lifes. She is — or certainly was between 1968 and 1978 — energetically involved in matters of pictorial structure that clearly differentiate her work from that of painters who at the time maintained a greater adherence to photography.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the <a href="http://en.museicapitolini.org/" target="_blank">Musei Capitolini</a> in Rome found itself at the <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/270948/italians-protect-iranian-presidents-virgin-eyes-from-nude-art-during-museum-visit/" target="_blank">center of a controversy</a> as news spread <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23statuenude" target="_blank">worldwide</a> of the censorship of some of its famous nude statues in anticipation of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani&#8217;s visit to the institution. While widely reported as a means to avoid offending the dignitary, the measure has stirred trouble of another kind in the Italian capital, with — unsurprisingly — all parties denying responsibility for it and an internal investigation now underway.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Local,</em> both Rouhani and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi <a href="http://www.thelocal.it/20160127/italy-baffled-over-who-endorsed-nude-statue-cover-up" target="_blank">denied</a> knowing about the seemingly Minimalism-inspired transformation, in which <em>someone</em> ordered that the marble sculptures be hidden beneath white boxes during Rouhani&#8217;s tour. Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini labelled the deed &#8220;incomprehensible,&#8221; and attempted to distance Renzi&#8217;s office from the matter.</p>
<p>“I never spoke about it being the responsibility of the Capitoline superintendents,&#8221; Franceschini <a href="http://www.corriere.it/politica/16_gennaio_27/statue-coperte-visita-rouhani-governo-non-sapeva-2ffbc734-c4e1-11e5-9850-7f16b4fde305.shtml" target="_blank">told</a> <em>Corriere.it</em>. &#8220;It’s clear that there was an excess of zeal on the part of those in charge of organizing such events, who made the decision, without telling, as I already said, either the prime minister or I.”</p>
<div id="attachment_271589" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271589" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/renzirouhani.jpeg" alt="Hassan Rouhani and Matteo Renzi (images via Wikipedia)" width="640" height="435" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/renzirouhani-265x180.jpeg 265w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/renzirouhani-768x521.jpeg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/renzirouhani.jpeg 978w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hassan Rouhani and Matteo Renzi (images <a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasan_Rouhani#/media/File:Hassan_Rouhani_2.jpg" target="_blank">via</a> <a href="https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Renzi" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>)</p></div>
<p>The Iranian President also said he had &#8220;no contact on the subject&#8221; with Italian authorities, but did not seem affected by the restrictions imposed on some of the greatest cultural gems from antiquity in his name.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that the Italians are very hospitable, a people who seek to make their guests&#8217; visits as pleasant as possible, and I thank them for that,&#8221; Rouhani told reporters.</p>
<p>Paolo Aquilanti, secretary general to Renzi, has ordered an investigation in an attempt to settle the situation, just as some members of the public have called on those responsible for the veiling be held accountable. The Italian media is now <a href="http://www.corriere.it/politica/16_gennaio_27/statue-coperte-visita-rouhani-governo-non-sapeva-2ffbc734-c4e1-11e5-9850-7f16b4fde305.shtml" target="_blank">spotlighting</a> Ilva Sapora, who since 2013 has directed the office in charge of organizing<span class="s1"> state ceremonies and honors, examining her for a number of other political slip-ups. According to <em><a href="https://www.lastampa.it/2016/01/28/esteri/dai-rolex-dei-sauditi-al-cibo-scadente-tutte-le-gaffe-del-capo-del-cerimoniale-4Ic4UCFHvbF8fNJNpgzW7M/pagina.html" target="_blank">La Stampa</a></em>, Sapora — who, the paper notes, does not speak English although her job necessitates speaking with many foreign delegations — forgot to invite an important Kuwaiti general to a dinner held in honor of last September&#8217;s Eurofighter deal between Kuwait and Italy. Sapora was also allegedly involved in a <a href="http://www.lastampa.it/2016/01/08/italia/politica/rissa-tra-i-funzionari-italiani-per-i-rolex-regalati-degli-sceicchi-nI1d2V8rywkKvhpudZsLfO/pagina.html" target="_blank">scandal</a> last December in which Italian diplomats were accused of accepting pricey Rolex watches as gifts from Saudi officials, in violation of Italian law.</span></p>
<p>The investigation is already shaping up to be a complicated one, which simply shows that Italian officials have not yet learned the quick-and-easy solution to deploy when your team slips up: blame the <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/657270071979585536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">young intern</a>.</p>
<p>The incident follows a similar controversy that occurred just last October. Officials, as <em>The Local</em> <a href="http://www.thelocal.it/20151007/renzi-covers-nude-statue-to-spare-sheikhs-blushes" target="_blank">reported</a>, deemed Jeff Koons&#8217; &#8220;Gazing Ball (Barberini Faun)&#8221; <a href="http://www.musefirenze.it/en/jeff-koons-in-florence/" target="_blank">at the Palazzo Vecchio</a> too risqué for the eyes of the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. They used — of all things — a windbreaker bearing the <em>fleur de lis</em> to cover up the sculpture&#8217;s anatomically explicit manspread. Curiously, that instance of censorship, then reported as the result of a decision by Renzi&#8217;s office, did not receive as much attention as this most recent fiasco.</p>

<p>The stylized lily actually seems to be a popular visual to use for censorship: in another effort to shroud marble members, paper <em>fleurs de lis</em> and fig leafs embellished the groins of statues in the Salle des Illustres in Toulouse&#8217;s city hall during a blood drive on Saturday. As <em>La Depeche</em> <a href="http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2016/01/26/2263782-statues-en-salle-des-illustres-le-mystere-des-sexes-caches.html" target="_blank">reported</a>, the cutouts were the work of the drive&#8217;s organizers, who found the sculptures too sexual for their event.</p>
<p>On this side of the Atlantic, one public sculpture is a regular for being kept under drapes by US politicians: the Department of Justice&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_Justice" target="_blank">Spirit of Justice</a> statue, which depicts a bare-breasted Lady Justice, spent three years under $8,000 curtains during Attorney General John Ashcroft&#8217;s tenure so photos and videos of him delivering speeches would remain nipple-free. While Ashcroft&#8217;s successor removed the drapes in 2005, Lady Justice <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/368760/obama-admin-covers-naked-lady-justice-andrew-johnson" target="_blank">hid in darkness</a> again in 2014, during Obama&#8217;s major speech regarding revisions to the NSA&#8217;s operations.</p>

<p>CHICAGO — The Modern Wing of the Art Institute of Chicago, which opened in 2009, has reinstated its contemporary collection after giving over most of the space in 2015 to a much-lauded <a href="http://www.artic.edu/charles-ray-sculpture-1997-2014" target="_blank">retrospective</a> of the American sculptor Charles Ray. Rather than just reinstalling everything that was there before, the contemporary galleries are now centered around 44 works donated to the museum by Chicago collectors Stefan Edlis and Gael Neeson, touted by the museum as &#8220;the largest gift in the Art Institute&#8217;s 136-year history.&#8221; The new collection was curated by James Rondeau, today <a href="http://www.artic.edu/blog/2015/12/11/now-open-new-contemporary" target="_blank">appointed</a> as the director of the museum.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.artic.edu/exhibition/new-contemporary" target="_blank">Edlis-Neeson Collection</a> consists mostly of work by American Pop Artists from the 1950s and &#8217;60s, with smaller sets of works by Pop Art-influenced artists from the 1970s through the &#8217;90s, plus a few works by artists at either end of that time period. So there are seminal works by Robert Rauschenberg (an early collage, mixed-media painting from 1955); &#8220;number&#8221; and &#8220;alphabet&#8221; paintings by Jasper Johns from 1959; and a selection of some of the most iconic silkscreen-on-canvas paintings from the early 1960s by Andy Warhol. His &#8220;Twelve Jackies&#8221; and &#8220;Little Race Riot,&#8221; both from 1964, represent some of his earliest statements about the effects of mass media upon our capacity for empathy. By taking an image of Jackie Kennedy at John F. Kennedy&#8217;s funeral, or a moment of racial violence, and silk-screening the image again and again on a series of canvasses, Warhol recorded his own inability to respond emotionally to televised tragedy. As the artist himself said about the Kennedy assassination (in an interview quoted in the book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SEUB8KO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" target="_blank">POPism: The Warhol Sixties</a></em>):</p>
<blockquote><p>I heard the news over the radio when I was alone painting in my studio. I don&#8217;t think I missed a stroke. I wanted to know what was going on out there, but that was the extent of my reaction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mixed in with the irony of the artist&#8217;s vision is the additional historical irony that these works are now taken as signifiers of historical value — hence their central position in the collection of a mega-rich donor.</p>
<div id="attachment_271554" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271554" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Edlis-Neeson-collection-installation-view-Hartigan.jpg" alt="Edlis Neeson collection installation view Hartigan" width="640" height="360" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Edlis-Neeson-collection-installation-view-Hartigan-291x164.jpg 291w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Edlis-Neeson-collection-installation-view-Hartigan-768x432.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Edlis-Neeson-collection-installation-view-Hartigan-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Edlis-Neeson-collection-installation-view-Hartigan.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Installation view of &#8216;The New Contemporary&#8217; at the Art Institute of Chicago (photo by the author of Hyperallergic)</p></div>
<p>The presence of several photography-inspired paintings by Gerhard Richter from the 1960s and &#8217;70s, chromogenic prints by Cindy Sherman from the 1980s, and more recent works by Richard Prince, suggests that the collection was put together mainly with an eye that has followed the influence of Pop Art Irony on succeeding generations of artists. Richter&#8217;s &#8220;Hunting Party&#8221; begs the questions: did the painter blur the source image when painting it, or was the original photo blurred? The latter usually indicates lack of skill — so does Richter&#8217;s skillfully painted rendering of blurriness solicit our praise, or is it an ironic commentary on the idea of skill in painting?</p>
<div id="attachment_271556" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271556" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sherman_Untitled-92_1981.jpg" alt="Sherman_Untitled-92_1981" width="640" height="320" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sherman_Untitled-92_1981-291x146.jpg 291w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sherman_Untitled-92_1981-768x384.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sherman_Untitled-92_1981-1024x512.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sherman_Untitled-92_1981.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cindy Sherman, &#8220;Untitled #92&#8221; (1981) (image couresty The Art Institute of Chicago, Gift of Edlis/Neeson Collection. © Cindy Sherman)</p></div>
<p>In Sherman&#8217;s <em>Untitled </em>series from 1981, which shows the photographer posing in various female guises, the lighting and staging of each image automatically has the viewer searching for visual references — stills from old movies, magazine images of reclining women, classical chiaroscuro paintings. She shakes our perception that a photo depicts a real event or a real emotion (even if Sherman&#8217;s work, ironically, often evokes real pathos). Richard Prince&#8217;s <em>Girlfriends</em> series seems to say that even irony needed to be reinvigorated as an artistic response. His appropriations of images of semi-nude women posing next to motorcycles might be ironic commentaries on sexism (&#8220;I am showing you this because I am amused that someone would attach value to these displays&#8221;) or they might just be too unchanged from their source material to be anything other than a bunch of trashy pictures of unclothed females. Either way, the presence of so many of them in this collection reinforces the &#8220;story&#8221; that is being told here: the attempt to make meaningful art out of irony, appropriation, banality, quotation, and self-reference is an enduring strand in late 20th-century art.</p>

<p>In numerical terms, the museum has received much larger bequests. The world-class Impressionist and Post-Impressionist collections, for example, are the result of <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/79.html">two donations in the 1920s</a>. Four hundred works by early 20th-century American artists, such as John Marin and Marsden Hartley, were <a href="http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/Ryerson/Making-History/7">given by Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe</a> in the 1940s, from her and her husband Alfred Stieglitz&#8217;s collection. After a brief pause to dig around in <a href="http://www.artic.edu/exhibition/new-contemporary">the publicity materials</a>, it soon becomes apparent that &#8220;largest donation in the museum&#8217;s history&#8221; actually means &#8220;largest in terms of current market value.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably best not to dwell on the fact that one gilded and carved wood-framed mirror from 1988 by Jeff Koons is probably worth more dollars than half of those Monet and Degas paintings. Better just to appreciate the latest bequest on its own artistic terms, which are that it comprises a formidable expansion<b> </b>of a museum collection that was already telling a well-illustrated story of post-WWII art.</p>

<p><i></i>Buenos Aires-born comics writer Héctor Germán Oesterheld was nearing his 59th birthday when heavily militarized Argentine death squads kidnapped him in the spring of 1977. The fascist dictatorship had produced a “dirty war,” which meant that a military regime had begun silencing leftist sentiment by force. Government officials found the political themes in Oesterheld’s very popular comics — among them, the graphic biography of revolutionary &#8220;Che&#8221; Guevara that Oesterheld had penned with Argentine father-and-son artists Alberto and Enrique Breccia — cause for punishment. They yanked it out of circulation and destroyed the book’s printing plates.</p>
<p>Oesterheld’s support of an aggressive left-wing guerrilla group called Montoneros in the 1970s — backed by the writer’s four grown daughters — angered members of the violent military campaign that had occupied Argentina’s government. When troops captured all four of the Oesterheld women, the fact that two of them were pregnant mattered little. Other than 19-year-old Beatriz, whose body was later found, none of them were ever seen again.</p>
<p>&#8220;My life was wonderful, and we were all very close,&#8221; Héctor’s widow, Elsa Sanchez de Oesterheld, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/argentine-grandmothers-running-out-of-time-in-search-for-missing/2012/06/03/gJQAqzr6CV_story.html" target="_blank">told <i>The Washington Post</i></a> in 2012. &#8220;And then they took it all away, all of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A journalist and writer of well-liked children&#8217;s stories and short books in the years before he disappeared, Oesterheld eventually prospered as a writer of comics. He worked with Alberto Breccia and Italian creator Hugo Pratt, who would go on to earn critical and popular acclaim for the internationally bestselling black-and-white <i>Corto Maltese</i> graphic novel series.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oesterheld played an important role in the development of the Argentine comic between the 1950s and the 1970s,&#8221; University of Iowa professor Ana Merino wrote in the <a href="http://www.ijoca.com/" target="_blank"><i>International Journal of Comic Art</i></a> in 2001. &#8220;He unknowingly opened up a bridge between fantastic and comic literature, showing that comics could be as intense as literature, and in turn, can offer alternative aesthetic possibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Comics flourished in Argentina during a “Golden Age” that began in the mid-1940s, and Oesterheld began publishing his own magazines, featuring his strips in them. With artist Francisco Solano López – another Buenos Aires native, who fled to Madrid to escape the death squads — the prolific Oesterheld scripted a black-and-white science-fiction/adventure comic called <i>El Eternauta</i>. Translated by writer and poet Erica Mena, a nearly 400-page oblong English adaptation collects Oesterheld and López&#8217;s serial comic, positioning it as a single chilling, taut, post-apocalyptic graphic novel.</p>
<div id="attachment_269458" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ETERNONAUT-223.jpg"><img class="wp-image-269458" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ETERNONAUT-223.jpg" alt="From The Eternonaut" width="640" height="464" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ETERNONAUT-223-248x180.jpg 248w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ETERNONAUT-223-768x557.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ETERNONAUT-223-1024x742.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ETERNONAUT-223.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">From &#8216;The Eternaut&#8217; (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>In <i><a href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/eternaut/" target="_blank">The Eternaut</a></i>, a comics scriptwriter is visited by a mysterious man named Juan Salvo, who appears in the writer&#8217;s home office as an apparition before assuming human form. Time travel has exhausted the guest, but he shares his story, serving as the tale’s narrator.</p>
<p>Salvo recounts an attic card game played by a group of science enthusiasts and hobbyists that is broken up by a tabletop radio&#8217;s alarming news: American atomic bomb testing has yielded radioactive dust that he and his friends believe to be blanketing the street — and killing neighbors — below the attic window. The sloping ceilings play no small role in the cramped, constricted atmosphere that Oesterheld scripts. López&#8217;s perpetual cross-hatching darkens the attic sequence&#8217;s barren corners, while the characters’ bulky cheekbones and forehead creases are carved out with short dashes and thick black strokes.</p>
<p>Salvo&#8217;s pack of card players watch through narrow windows as death unfolds below. Hysteria sets in quickly. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to die like rats! Food, air, everything will run out!&#8221; says electronics aficionado Lucas Herbert, one of the panicked men at the card table.</p>
<p><i>The Eternaut</i> isn&#8217;t without the hyperbole we typically associate with pulpy genre yarns and hallowed television anthology series. And although Salvo’s narration — rife with Cold War–era technophobia, mind-control horrors, and fear of an omnipresent enemy’s reach — is often rich and lyrical, this isn’t likely to hook those who didn&#8217;t rush out to snag the recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Barbarella-Minute-Eater-Slightly-Oversized-Edition/dp/1594651043/" target="_blank"><i> Barbarella</i> volume</a> from Humanoids or IDW&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Howard-Nostrands-Nightmares-Chilling-Archives/dp/1631401513" target="_blank">Howard Nostrand collections</a>. But as Oesterheld’s characters don’t stay put for long, most will at least marvel at López&#8217;s output when he&#8217;s tasked with drafting the exploration of the still streets of the neighborhood. Clad in homemade hazmat suits, the card-players leave Salvo’s wife and daughter behind in order to forage for supplies, only to discover that aliens have invaded their quiet corner of Buenos Aires, and that the deadly &#8220;snow&#8221; is just one component of the attack.</p>

<p>The action dazzles within <i>The Eternaut</i>&#8216;s cleverly composed panels. López employs gradients and heavy blacks to set off gunpowder clouds, and each sphere is built with dense detail. Even when set pieces are relegated to the far background, a gargantuan stadium, a subway station, and the exteriors of neighbors’ manicured houses are all magnificent structures when rendered in López&#8217;s refined linework. Picket fences surround the quaint homes that line Salvo&#8217;s suburban block, and out of context, these appear to be serene landscapes, with the deadly &#8220;snowflakes&#8221; rendering nearby tall pines fluffy and cotton-topped. But the peaceful exterior is deceiving, and the truth for <i>The Eternaut</i>’s nerdy underdogs — who aren&#8217;t just a part of a sci-fi story but of &#8220;an exploration of the human condition,&#8221; per scholar Martin Hadis&#8217;s foreword — is anything but.</p>
<p>Twenty years after <i>El Eternauta</i> debuted in the weekly magazine <i>Hora Cero</i>, state-sponsored terrorists began canvassing Argentina, torturing and killing scores of suspected socialists and leftists. The United States Institute of Peace <a href="”http://www.usip.org/publications/truth-commission-argentina" target="”_blank”">estimates</a> the number of kidnapping victims to be between 10,000 and 30,000 people between 1976 and 1983. Taken alongside the news of his widow’s perpetual search for any semblance of closure, it’s as if Oesterheld was telegraphing in <i>The Eternaut</i> the horrors that would befall him at the hands of his own repellent government. And in his depiction of a persistent, insect-like army of extraterrestrials (the underlings of a far more significant enemy) — scampering about in droves, armed with high-tech weaponry and cannibalistic inclinations, disrupting all sense of human civilization in their overlord&#8217;s efforts to seize control of the planet — Oesterheld hit devastatingly close to home.</p>

<p>In a 2011 commercial for his fragrance &#8220;Someday,&#8221; Justin Bieber — then just 17-years-old — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVxVpNvb79g" target="_blank">flies</a> across sun-streaked heavens, a recently spritzed blond beauty in his arms. It&#8217;s hard to not feel some exhilaration (whether because of the heart-thumping music or the sheer cheesiness) from the video, which was just one of many clips projected successively on a screen as part of <em><a href="http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/FelixBernstein" target="_blank">Bieber Bathos Elegy</a></em>, a sold-out performance by <a href="http://www.felixbernstein.com/" target="_blank">Felix Bernstein</a> and directed by Gabe Rubin that premiered this month at the Whitney Museum. That feeling of thrill, which characterizes Bieber at the start of his career as a newly discovered child pop star, was tinged with public trepidation as he matured into the inked young adult who accumulated a record of tomfoolery and criminality, eventually moving towards the solemnity found in his music today. Bernstein traces that path of emotion in <em>Bieber Bathos Elegy</em>, delivering it with a generous serving of absurdity but also a sincerity in reading the world of celebrity and identity.</p>
<div id="attachment_270493" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270493" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2276.jpg" alt="Felix Bernstein, 'Bieber Bathos Elegy,' performed on January 15, 2016 at the Whitney Museum of American Art" width="640" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2276-270x180.jpg 270w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2276-768x512.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2276-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2276.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Felix Bernstein, &#8216;Bieber Bathos Elegy,&#8217; performed on January 15, 2016 at the Whitney Museum of American Art</p></div>
<p>As its name suggests, the three-act play/musical/opera/experimental theater — the entire show defies classic categorization — explores the modern phenomenon of Justin Bieber and stardom bred in the digital age through concepts established by the ancient Greeks: Alexander Pope&#8217;s concept of bathos, wrapped up in a poetic lament. In his artist&#8217;s note, Bernstein defines bathos as:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he failure to achieve pathos — the failure to achieve catharsis and the ubiquitous sympathy associated with drama — bathos: to land in the ridiculous, to be ridiculed, or to ridicule oneself — to blame oneself, instead of finding relief or sympathy or blaming another or fate. Pathos is a kind of mutual pity: bathos is self-pity, since no audience member cares.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bernstein plays with the psychological throughout, pulling the audience into an often bewildering but amusing rollercoaster of a mindset. At the start, he merges childhood trauma and levity as he alludes to Bieber&#8217;s ridiculous past. Donning a mask designed by <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sorenroi" target="_blank">Soren Roi</a> that resembles sewn-together skin flaps, Bernstein appears as a frenzied adolescent seated in front of his laptop in the first act (dubbed &#8220;The Pervert&#8217;s Lair of Memories&#8221;), obsessively pulling up an array of YouTube videos and old clips — all viewable to the audience on a larger screen — at times speaking directly to us. Old Christmas sing-a-longs, a snippet of the theme song from &#8220;Blues Clues,&#8221; a girl on a China&#8217;s Got Talent-esque show singing &#8220;Memory&#8221; from &#8220;Cats&#8221; –  these musical videos are among the amusing digital detritus Bernstein shows alongside gems like the &#8220;Someday&#8221; advertisement, a segment of teen Bieber <a href="https://youtu.be/eX-QE-FbC90?t=7m9s" target="_blank">playing</a> &#8220;Would You Rather&#8221; on &#8220;The Talk,&#8221; and a three-year-old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTCm8tdHkfI" target="_blank">crying</a> because she loves Justin Bieber and &#8220;knows he loves me back.&#8221; Bieber&#8217;s digital past is our comedy — evidenced by the laughter-filled theater — and thus his tragedy, and although it built his obsessed fanbase, it&#8217;s one from which he must distance himself to mature.</p>
<div id="attachment_270494" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270494" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2513.jpg" alt="Felix Bernstein, 'Bieber Bathos Elegy,' performed on January 15, 2016 at the Whitney Museum of American Art" width="640" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2513-270x180.jpg 270w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2513-768x512.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2513-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2513.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Felix Bernstein, &#8216;Bieber Bathos Elegy,&#8217; performed on January 15, 2016 at the Whitney Museum of American Art</p></div>
<p>This performance through video reminds of Bernstein&#8217;s own creative background: for years, Bernstein has chosen YouTube as his preferred medium of representation, posting videos of himself seamlessly adopting an array of identities. As much as it concerns the Canadian crooner&#8217;s self-image, <em>Bieber Bathos Elegy</em> is also a diaristic work that reflects particularly on growing up in a media-saturated era. Like John Jesurun&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArO-6l3Q-HY" target="_blank">performances</a> that inundate us with all varieties of digital content, Bernstein&#8217;s debut integrates references to home videos, Broadway hits, top 40 charts, and more. This sea of information collapses time and creates confusion, presenting a consumed self who&#8217;s searching for anchorage — as emphasized by Bernstein&#8217;s slipping into a number of characters as he does in his videos. In this sense, <em>Bieber Bathos Elegy </em>is also reminiscent of the chaotic and high-paced videos of Ryan Trecartin that explore indeterminate identities. And like Trecartin&#8217;s work, Bernstein unfolds bizarre scenes whose meanings aren&#8217;t always clear but remain riveting from their hyperactive spirit. Through this muddle presented in the frame of the celebrity, he examines his own personal purposes and perplexities, too.</p>
<p>A sudden emotional shift away, not unlike a jump cut, from the levity Bernstein sets at the start occurs in Act Two, when Bieber, played by immaculately coiffed and buffed <a href="http://lukesmithers.com/" target="_blank">Luke Smithers</a>, makes his appearance as an expressionless angel, a figure of exemplary conduct but wholly colorless. Scaling an A-frame ladder as a choir kneels before him in reverence of an idol, he is far from the carefree Bieber with a case of perma-smile Bernstein showed in his video selection. He resembles the Bieber of today, kept in line by his awareness of constant scrutiny, knowing every move triggers YouTube view counts, Twitter retweets, Facebook shares that shape personal brand. Infamous for his <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/28/showbiz/gallery/justin-bieber-2013/" target="_blank">slew of antics</a>, as he attempts to demonstrate maturation, he is as critics have described the 21-year-old, now &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/arts/music/justin-bieber-and-one-direction-joyless-boys.html?_r=0" target="_blank">joyless</a>&#8221; and highly aware of his need to at least <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/a-void-where-justin-bieber-usually-is" target="_blank">express remorse</a><em>. </em>As the <em>New Yorker</em>&#8216;s Carrie Battan wrote, &#8220;He has either retreated so deeply into a state of contrition that he has lost his taste for fun or, more likely, become so fatigued by the process that he can’t muster the energy required to have any.&#8221; Bernstein alludes to such media profiles with simple switches in mood augmented by musical lamentations.</p>
<div id="attachment_270496" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-270496" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2392.jpg" alt="Felix Bernstein, 'Bieber Bathos Elegy,' performed on January 15, 2016 at the Whitney Museum of American Art" width="320" height="213" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2392-270x180.jpg 270w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2392-768x512.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2392-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2392.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Felix Bernstein, &#8216;Bieber Bathos Elegy,&#8217; performed on January 15, 2016 at the Whitney Museum of American Art</p></div>
<p>The banger &#8220;Where Are Ü Now,&#8221; off <em>Purpose, </em>is one of Bieber&#8217;s most emotional, and it&#8217;s the plea Bernstein chooses to herald the angel-pop star&#8217;s arrival, sung by a choir of youths (millennials, if we must). Led by the dynamic <a href="http://www.shelleyhirsch.com/shelley/" target="_blank">Shelley Hirsch</a>, the <a href="http://whatever21.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">WHATEVER 21</a>-clad group also sings a phenomenal rendition of &#8220;Tomorrow&#8221; from <em>Annie</em> in the ingenious style of a vocal warm-up that deconstructs the ditty into repetitive articulations. Although <em>Bieber Bathos Elegy</em> doesn&#8217;t feature many major characters, with Bernstein contributing the majority of its dialogue, the choir&#8217;s gripping performance shines as the most memorable. Reiteration tends to breed reassurance; the tune becomes a mantra of encouragement that ups the drama of <em>Bieber Bathos Elegy</em> as we, too, start to root for Bieber&#8217;s successful untethering from his IRL transgressions we witnessed through URLs. &#8220;Tomorrow,&#8221; along with &#8220;Memory,&#8221; recurs throughout the performance in various musical styles, weaving this hope for a better future — &#8220;The sun&#8217;ll come out tomorrow!&#8221; the chorus chants — with notions of nostalgia — &#8220;I was beautiful then,&#8221; Bernstein croons in one scene. He stands there as an image of lost glamor, dressed as a crone in a fur coat and glittering jewels, his vocals accompanied by Rubin&#8217;s innovative, sinister arrangement of colliding notes performed by a three-piece band. In these moments that conflate time, musical genre, and ideals of identity, <em>Bieber Bathos Elegy</em> surges in emotion in its examination of success and contemporary stardom.</p>
<div id="attachment_270499" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270499" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2700.jpg" alt="Felix Bernstein, 'Bieber Bathos Elegy,' performed on January 15, 2016 at the Whitney Museum of American Art" width="640" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2700-270x180.jpg 270w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2700-768x512.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2700-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2700.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Felix Bernstein, &#8216;Bieber Bathos Elegy,&#8217; performed on January 15, 2016 at the Whitney Museum of American Art</p></div>
<p>But the performance already reveals its ending in its title — that this saturation of emotion, whether remorse or self-pity, will not lead to a true purging of character. By the end, Bernstein, still entranced with Bieber, faces his idol who floats as a projection against a cosmic sky. The result is ridiculous, made more so as digital Bieber ridicules Bernstein in a teasing spiel (again, reminiscent of <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5nclmEYkqk?t=28m40s" target="_blank">quick-cut interchanges</a> in Trecartin&#8217;s work) that he spits out in a monotonous, somewhat glitchy voice: &#8220;Transgression is meaningless&#8221;; &#8220;suck my dick, faggot&#8217;; &#8220;I&#8217;m not yours&#8221;; &#8220;believe it, bitch, slut&#8221; or &#8220;and I&#8217;m like&#8230;&#8221; While as an angel he has literally risen above his wrongdoing, his words reek of artificiality and adolescence. Bernstein uses the framework of poetry to deliver loathing, an ugliness of art that demonstrates Bieber&#8217;s failure to reach sublimity. All too self-aware, he is but a whiney dude with a nice bod.</p>
<div id="attachment_270500" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270500" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2609.jpg" alt="Felix Bernstein, 'Bieber Bathos Elegy,' performed on January 15, 2016 at the Whitney Museum of American Art" width="640" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2609-270x180.jpg 270w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2609-768x512.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2609-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2609.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Felix Bernstein, &#8216;Bieber Bathos Elegy,&#8217; performed on January 15, 2016 at the Whitney Museum of American Art</p></div>
<p>We, too, experience a moment of self-awareness early in the performance. After &#8220;Someday&#8221; streams, Bernstein yells to his audience, &#8220;I’ll give you more! This is what you want, right?&#8221; His exclamation acknowledges that whether we idolize or loathe him, we expended our time to watch a performance that could be about only Bieber. We trekked to the Whitney because there&#8217;s some kind of delight in a Bieber-filled experience: we went for spectacle. The dramatic singing and exaggerated performance Bieber Bathos Elegy delivers is satisfying — although at times it is a little too over-the-top, making for easy comedy. In such moments, it feels like Bernstein is over-amplifying his antics for a setting where he is all too aware of having to perform — in comparison to the space of video-making, where although he is performing, his &#8220;audience&#8221; is mediated through a nonjudgmental camera. But in playing with the audience&#8217;s want for pleasure, Bernstein contemplates the purpose of artistic expression in relation to the pressures of an expectant public with a persistent gaze.</p>

<p>Five dancers who started their careers in the 1940s redefined dance in the United States, becoming some of the first American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_ballerina_assoluta" target="_blank">prima ballerinas</a> in the world&#8217;s top companies, from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballets_Russes" target="_blank">Ballets Russes</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Opera_Ballet" target="_blank">Paris Opera Ballet</a>. And they were all American Indians from Oklahoma.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvonne_Chouteau" target="_blank">Yvonne Chouteau</a>, one of the &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Moons" target="_blank">Five Moons</a>,&#8221; as they were anointed, <a href="http://newsok.com/prima-ballerina-yvonne-chouteau-dies-at-86/article/5474910" target="_blank">died this past Sunday at the age of 86</a>. Along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscelyne_Larkin" target="_blank">Moscelyne Larkin</a> (Shawnee, 1925–2012), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosella_Hightower" target="_blank">Rosella Hightower</a> (Choctaw, 1920–2008), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Tallchief" target="_blank">Marjorie Tallchief</a> (Osage, b. 1926), and, most famously, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Tallchief" target="_blank">Maria Tallchief</a> (Osage, 1925–2013), she rose in the ranks of dance when ballet was still not widely appreciated in this country. The women had distinct careers, but they all danced when they were young <a href="https://arts.ok.gov/Art_at_the_Capitol/Capitol_Collection/Larsen/Flight_of_Spirit_Details.html" target="_blank">at powows</a> and caught performances by the traveling Ballets Russes and other companies, propelling them to study professionally.</p>
<p>Chouteau, who was<i> </i>Shawnee-Cherokee, explained how she started ballet in Lili Cockerille Livingston&#8217;s book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Indian-Ballerinas-Cockerille-Livingston/dp/0806131349">American Indian Ballerinas</a>:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, my parents were not about to let ballet take me away from my Indian dancing, but they made it possible for me to do both. Looking back, that was very wise, because the recognition I had gained as an Indian dancer offered me tremendous opportunities to perform. I think the San Diego Exposition was the first place that I did both ballet and Indian solos. From then on, I rarely did my exhibition Indian dances without at least one ballet piece. &#8230; I had been taught the sanctity of dance as it is seen in the eyes of the Indian and approached ballet the same way.</p></blockquote>

<p>Chouteau joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo at the age of 14 after, as she put in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUWarJZcr2E" target="_blank">2005 documentary</a>, she auditioned on &#8220;a lark.&#8221; After touring the world, she returned to Oklahoma and helped start the dance program at the University of Oklahoma in 1960, then went on to direct the Oklahoma City Civic Ballet. You could fill a long litany with the five dancer&#8217;s accomplishments, but Larkin&#8217;s time in the Original Ballet Russe and her founding of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_Ballet" target="_blank">Tulsa Ballet </a>stand out in particular. Hightower was also part of Ballet Russe and remained involved in ballet throughout France, earning the Chevalier de la Légion in 1975 — while her greatest feat came <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=940CE6DB173CE13BBC4951DFB566838C659EDE" target="_blank">in 1947</a>, when she learned the lead for <em>Giselle</em> in just under <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/arts/dance/05hightower.html" target="_blank">five hours</a>. Marjorie Tallchief was the first American &#8220;premiere danseuse étoile&#8221; in the Paris Opéra. Her older sister, the unrivaled Maria Tallchief, married choreographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Balanchine" target="_blank">George Balanchine</a>, who in the 1940s and &#8217;50s created leading parts for her in his major ballets, including <em>The Firebird</em>, <em>Swan Lake</em>, and the Sugarplum Fairy in <em>The Nutcracker. </em></p>
<p>The five never performed together, although all of them but Maria Tallchief, who by then had retired, took part in Louis Ballard&#8217;s 1967 <em>The Four Moons</em> at the Second Oklahoma Indian Ballerina Festival. The piece merged movement from ballet with the dancers&#8217; heritage and featured Hightower&#8217;s fluid, Choctaw-inspired solo; Larkin&#8217;s Shawnee-influenced dance with quick, compacting movement; Marjorie Tallchief&#8217;s gestural performance, which evolved from Osage dance; and Chouteau&#8217;s somber choreography, developed from the Cherokee and Shawnee dances of her youth.</p>
<p>Nora Boustany wrote in Hightower&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-hightower9-2008nov09-story.html" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a> </em>obituary that the women&#8217;s &#8220;remarkable accomplishments showcased American dance and talent to the world when Russian stars still dominated that scene.&#8221; And as Larkin said <a href="http://ndepth.newsok.com/five-indian-ballerinas" target="_blank">in a short documentary</a> produced by NewsOK: &#8220;It&#8217;s not just a fluke that we are all Native Americans and that we all became dancers.&#8221; In the Oklahoma State Capitol, a mural of the five dancers adorns the rotunda. Painted by <a href="http://www.larsenstudio.com/" target="_blank">Mike Larsen</a>, it shows them posed in white tutus, the shadows of the Trail of Tears behind them. Each had a unique style and left her own legacy, but together they promoted their indigenous heritage through the art of dance.</p>

<p>LOS ANGELES — During a recent visit to Japan, I happened upon one of its novelty animal cafés, one specializing in owls. What I initially mistook for taxidermy specimens were live birds; the owls opened their eyes and rotated their heads as I took a seat at a table. Unimpressed by what they saw — another gawking tourist — the birds averted their gaze. The experience was not unlike being in the presence of cats, who are similarly indifferent to strangers. I wondered about the leashes that tethered the owls to their perch, whether the cafe owners transported the birds at night to an aviary in which they could freely roam (probably not). Days later, I traveled to Nara, where sacred sika deer roam its parks and temples. The deer here, ostensibly wild, approach tourists for the rice crackers sold by street vendors throughout the city. Waiting expectantly near every attraction, they cajole approaching humans into giving up a free meal.</p>
<p>These human-animal interactions came to mind as I walked through Diana Thater’s retrospective, <em><a href="http://www.lacma.org/diana-thater#landing" target="_blank">The Sympathetic Imagination</a></em>, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Using her preferred medium of light and video, Thater asks us to consider how we perceive and inhabit the space of the museum and that of nature. Light and video installations simulate the subjectivities of of honeybees, dolphins, wolves, and tigers. In the age of the Anthropocene, man-made environments progressively encroach on wildlife, but how can humans rethink space as more than just a resource to be plundered or an experience to be consumed?</p>
<div id="attachment_264529" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/THATER_Knots_2001_DIA_02_labeled.jpg"><img class="wp-image-264529" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/THATER_Knots_2001_DIA_02_labeled-812x1024.jpg" alt="Diana Thater, &quot;knots + surfaces&quot; (2001), installation view at Dia Center for the Arts, New York (photo courtesy of Diana Thater and Fredrik Nilsen)" width="320" height="403" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/THATER_Knots_2001_DIA_02_labeled-143x180.jpg 143w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/THATER_Knots_2001_DIA_02_labeled-768x968.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/THATER_Knots_2001_DIA_02_labeled-812x1024.jpg 812w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Diana Thater, &#8220;knots + surfaces&#8221; (2001), installation view at Dia Center for the Arts, New York (photo courtesy Diana Thater and Fredrik Nilsen) (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>In “knots + surfaces” (2001), honeybees perform their dance across multicolored hexagons, which are projected onto the gallery walls and floor. No matter how closely we observe the bees or how much we breach the hive, the dance of the bees remain inscrutable. In “Untitled Videowall (Butterflies)” (2008), six video monitors depict footage of a single monarch butterfly taken from different angles. A fluorescent light bathes the room with a warm red-orange glow, while the images on the monitors are blurry and unfocused. Uninterested in pristine documentary footage of the <em>National Geographic</em> variety, the installation turns its subject into abstract forms.</p>
<p>Visible throughout the exhibition are the projectors, monitors, and lights that create the images and effects of the artwork. As much as we are transported to a different space, we are reminded of how light and video mediate that experience in the way images overlap across the edges of a gallery wall or how a single source of light changes the atmosphere of a room. Colors are broken down into their constituent parts; primary (red, green, blue) and secondary (cyan, magenta, yellow) colors recur as leitmotifs.</p>
<div id="attachment_264531" style="width: 651px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-264531" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/THATER_Butterflies_2008_1301_1b_labeled-1024x679.jpg" alt="Diana Thater, &quot;Untitled Videowall (Butterflies)&quot; (2008), installation view at 1301PE, Los Angeles (photo courtesy of 1301PE)" width="641" height="425" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/THATER_Butterflies_2008_1301_1b_labeled-271x180.jpg 271w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/THATER_Butterflies_2008_1301_1b_labeled-768x509.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/THATER_Butterflies_2008_1301_1b_labeled-1024x679.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Diana Thater, &#8220;Untitled Videowall (Butterflies)&#8221; (2008), installation view at 1301PE, Los Angeles (photo courtesy 1301PE)</p></div>
<p>In “China” (1995), six video projectors are arranged in a circle to create a panoramic image, divided into primary and secondary colors. The images surround the viewer with footage of two wolves being trained to sit still at the center of the circle. Standing between the projectors, the viewer is positioned both among and outside of the wolves, who can be seen in the periphery. Different durations and vantage points in each frame disorient the viewer’s experience of time and space. “Perfect Devotion Six” (2006) also documents wild animals in captivity, although instead of placing the viewer at the center, it suspends the perspective overhead and obscures the animals’ boundaries. Six monitors show different vantage points of an enclosure containing tigers, the cats flitting in and out of each frame.</p>
<p>While the psychology of animals may not be fully understood, the form and structure of the installations seem to reflect the subjective experience of animals in confinement. The exhibition’s title also suggests that imagination can enable us to sympathize with their experience of the world. The mobility of dolphins through aquatic space is the subject of “Delphine” (1999), which in contrast to “China” projects imagery of free and uninhibited movement. Dolphins swim freely through the museum space, cast in a magenta light. The installation evokes weightless and boundless movement.</p>
<div id="attachment_264535" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/THATER_Life_2015_HW09_labeled.jpg"><img class="wp-image-264535" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/THATER_Life_2015_HW09_labeled-881x1024.jpg" alt="Diana Thater, &quot;Life is a Time-Based Medium&quot; (2015), installation view at Hauser &amp; Wirth, London (photo courtesy of Alex Delfanne and Hauser &amp; Wirth)" width="320" height="372" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/THATER_Life_2015_HW09_labeled-155x180.jpg 155w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/THATER_Life_2015_HW09_labeled-768x893.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/THATER_Life_2015_HW09_labeled-881x1024.jpg 881w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Diana Thater, &#8220;Life is a Time-Based Medium&#8221; (2015), installation view at Hauser &amp; Wirth, London (photo courtesy Alex Delfanne and Hauser &amp; Wirth) (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>Two works in particular transport me back to my memories of Japan. “Life is a Time-Based Medium” (2015) projects the image of a Hindu temple in Jaipur, India, where rhesus monkeys are considered sacred. Past the image of the temple facade, a door leads to another room, where another projection depicts the inside of a theater screening a video of the temple’s monkeys. I think about the deer in Nara and the interdependence between humans and animals. The rhesus monkeys and sika deer look to humans for shelter and food, while humans look to them for spiritual and cultural sustenance. These are centuries-old relationships, and the spaces they inhabit just as old.</p>
<p>The owl that stares back at the camera in “A Cast of Falcons” (2008) is the only bird that is aware of its being watched, unlike the other birds wearing hoods that cover their eyes. I think of the snowy owl at the cafe in Osaka that stared back at me, the one who gave me such a long, piercing look, I had to turn away. In an artist commentary, Thater asks “What do I see when I look at the other and what does it see when it looks back at me?” <em>The Sympathetic Imagination</em> attempts to answer these questions by sharing space with these animals and imagining the shapes and colors of their inner lives.</p>

<p>MEXICO CITY — Lumping together groups of artists who have nothing more in common than geography is a risky curatorial proposition that often leads to mayhem. While sharing culture is fundamental to international creative exchange, this particular kind of generalizing is even more bizarre and less relevant when it takes place within the region that it seeks to highlight. <a href="http://unmismosol.info/" target="_blank"><em>Bajo el Mismo Sol</em></a> (or <em><a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/international-exhibitions/ussjumex" target="_blank">Under the Same Sun: Art from Latin America Today</a></em>)<em>, </em>now on view at <a href="http://fundacionjumex.org/en/sedes/museo-jumex" target="_blank">Museo Jumex</a>, brings together many of Latin America’s most famous artists for a rare homecoming, cramming them into primitive categories chosen by Western overlords and forced down the throats of hometown viewers.</p>
<p>Latin America is a big place, with every imaginable kind of art spread across the region. The show demonstrates a diversity of interests and issues, but falls far short of illustrating the breadth of art taking place across Mexico, Central, and South America. Organized in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/guggenheim-foundation/collaborations/map/latinamerica?gclid=CjwKEAiAt_K0BRCzjtv92_HGoR0SJAA9QNn_jcW3HfPvPqUcXa2_j_HzTuaesPkSEw51LEHMcPYErRoC4Vvw_wcB" target="_blank">Guggenheim UBS Global Map Initiative</a>, the exhibition gathers a complex web of contemporary artists voicing substantive ideas in many media. However, a majority of the art focuses on the same stereotypes Latin American artists have been cornered into making work about for decades: colonization, border politics, labor, social injustice, racism, corruption, poverty, etc. Another important element of the exhibition is that the 45 pieces on view were all recently acquired by the Guggenheim as part of the <a href="http://fundacionjumex.org/files/boletines/BP-UnderTheSameSun.pdf" target="_blank">initiative</a>, which is “aimed at bolstering access to and awareness of contemporary art from South and Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa.”</p>

<p>The show, according to the curators (Pablo León de la Barra of the Guggenheim UBS Global Map Initiative and &#8220;<a href="http://fundacionjumex.org/files/boletines/BP-UnderTheSameSun.pdf" target="_blank">colleagues at Museo Jumex</a>&#8220;), is divided into the categories of conceptualism, modernism, participation/emancipation, political activism, and the tropical. However, these categories are not given equal treatment throughout the show; politics, conceptualism, and social stratification blend together, blurring categorization, but purposefully steering the conversation surrounding contemporary art in Latin American toward the same tired political narrative. Latin American artists are lumped into readymade categories that misrepresent the complexity and depth of the region. I fear this Guggenheim initiative is reinforcing, rather than complicating, preexisting and outdated ideas about Latin America as defined by colonial conflict.</p>
<p>The 40 artists from 13 Latin American nations included in the show are not to blame. Many are pioneers who have been instrumental in putting Latin America on the global contemporary art map. Almost half of them (18 of the 40) don’t live in Latin America because their reach is limited within their own countries of origin. Meanwhile, a significant number of contemporary Latin American artists who make work beyond these comfortable categories were overlooked. One of the show&#8217;s strengths is the inclusion of some of the region’s most important women artists, including <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/246178/considering-cocoas-colonial-history/" target="_blank">Minerva Cuevas</a>, <a href="http://brooklynrail.org/2009/11/artseen/regina-jose-galindo" target="_blank">Regina José Galindo</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jun/28/artist-of-week-amalia-pica" target="_blank">Amalia Pica</a>, <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/152130/at-the-guggenheim-three-critical-takes-on-latin-america/" target="_blank">Tania Bruguera</a>, and <a href="http://fabricainutil.com/" target="_blank">Beatriz Santiago Muñoz</a>. Hats off to the Guggenheim for not being sexist on top of imperialist.</p>
<p>The artists chosen for the exhibition, for the most part, enjoy ample exposure in the United States and Europe. They therefore represent a good investment for the Guggenheim, but aren’t very representative of art being made right now in Latin America. Another problematic detail: the youngest artist in the show was born in 1978 and most of the work wasn’t made recently. More than a survey of Latin American art now, the show is a survey of Latin American art from around 2010, with some work from as early as the 1970s.</p>

<p>At least the show manages to be ironic. German-born and Uruguayan-raised artist <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/artists/934?locale=en" target="_blank">Luis Camnitzer</a>’s installation greets viewers with analog clicking sounds and flashes of warm light. Ten slide projectors are installed around the small space atop miscellaneous everyday materials — pedestals, chairs, paint buckets, and a winking stack of <a href="http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/sothebys-at-auction/2013/10/eugenio-lopez-jumex-museum.html" target="_blank">Jumex juices</a>. The work’s title, &#8220;<a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/33084" target="_blank">Art History Lesson no. 6</a>&#8221; (2000),<em> </em>and the show catalogue both suggest the piece is a recreation of a lecture hall. Did professors still use slide projectors in the year 2000? According to the official description, the work “points to the fact that art history is written by those in power, and tends to exclude certain accounts (including Latin America’s) from the canon around which the discipline organizes itself.” It feels like Camnitzer pulled one over on the institution, which is made to look as outdated as the slide projectors in his piece.</p>
<p>A video piece by <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/guggenheim-foundation/collaborations/map/latinamerica/artist/javier-tellez">Javer Téllez</a> called &#8220;One Flew Over the Void (Bala Perdida),&#8221; made in 2005, seems more relevant now than ever. A parade organized by the artist culminates with a man being launched out of a canon, from Tijuana to San Diego. The conversation about migration and border politics is especially poignant today as we listen to Donald Trump or consider the refugee crisis in Europe, but it isn’t a new conversation — just what the Guggenheim was looking for from a Latino artist.</p>

<p>When the show moves on to London from the Jumex, after already being shown in New York, it will provide Europeans with a false image that claims to represent a current reality, but it actually represents an outdated past. This leaves Western viewers with the impression that Latin American artists remain behind — specifically behind their European and US counterparts. Rather than highlighting exciting new ideas that are being created in Latin America, the Guggenheim is making the case for more of the same.</p>
<p>Border politics, environmental degradation, abuse of power, social stratification, and colonial capitalism remain relevant issues as Latin American countries aim to solidify their positions in the international pecking order. However, those conversations have evolved over the last decade and new conversations have begun. Where are post-internet, new media, and interactive design works? How about social practice? These new and relevant hybrid art practices are missing. Young artists are being told: You have to make work about how messed up your country is. They are being told they have to make Latin American art, according to guidelines enforced by outsiders through exploitive capitalism. There is a Western expectation that contemporary Latin American artists — along with their African, Asian, and Middle Eastern peers — make work that directly and obviously deals with regional politics. It isn’t that artists aren’t making abstract and ephemeral works in new media, but those new artists aren’t being featured as part of the emerging “scene” in Latin America, when, in fact, they are defining it.</p>

<p>What if <a href="http://www.muac.unam.mx/" target="_blank">MUAC</a> curator <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/210520/a-view-of-the-global-art-world-from-a-mexico-city-curator/" target="_blank">Cuauhtémoc Medina</a> mounted a show called, &#8220;Under the Same Clouds: Art from Europe Today&#8221;? How would a Latin American organize an exhibition that sums up all of Europe’s artistic complexity? That would never happen. That is the fundamental problem with this exhibition. We can’t use Latin American as a shorthand to encompass an incredible diversity of influences, languages, attitudes, and cultures. There is so much more happening here than this show represents and it’s unfair to Latin America and the rest of the world to limit and constrain the lion&#8217;s share of an entire continent to 45 works. Latin American artists are defining themselves beyond the narrow vision of institutions like the Guggenheim.</p>
<p>Given a different title, this exhibition would be excellent. This work <em>was </em>important for the development of contemporary Latin American art and it offers a rare opportunity to see works by many artists who rarely show in their region together in one place. The irony is that so much of the strongest art in the exhibition critiques the same Western elite that has made it valuable. This tension attests to the depth of the show&#8217;s roster, but also underlines the absolute and fundamental failure of the Guggenheim UBS Global Map Initiative to understand and define Latin American art.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is this Europe?” That’s the question German photographer </span><a href="http://kailoeffelbein.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kai Löffelbein</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> heard again and again from refugees landing on the island of Lesbos, Greece, this past fall, where <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34323007" target="_blank">2–4,000</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34323007" target="_blank"> migrants and refugees</a> were arriving daily.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So catastrophic is the situation there that, after dire sea crossings in leaky boats helmed by armed smugglers, many arrivals doubt they’ve come to the right place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The refugee crisis in Lesbos is one of the most dire in Europe, where more than <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/22/one-million-migrants-and-refugees-have-reached-europe-this-year-iom" target="_blank">one million refugees</a> arrived in 2015.

At least 42 people have drowned off trying to get to Lesbos in the past two weeks alone.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While abstracted statistics like these sum up the sheer magnitude of the situation, they fail to convey the individual experiences of refugees — it’s hard to empathize with numbers.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_269346" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-269346" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lesbos_loeffelbein_002.jpg" alt="Lesbos refugee crisis" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lesbos_loeffelbein_002-271x180.jpg 271w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lesbos_loeffelbein_002-768x511.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lesbos_loeffelbein_002-1024x681.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lesbos_loeffelbein_002.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A man arrives on Lesbos after crossing the Aegean Sea with his family.</p></div>
<p><a href="http://kailoeffelbein.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Löffelbein</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s black-and-white photographs offer a look at the small triumphs and daily struggles of the displaced. They range from hopeful to harrowing. Overcrowded dinghies traveling from the coast of Turkey navigate choppy waters; Spanish lifeguards and volunteers help people ashore. Relief and fear fill the faces of new arrivals, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who “cry, scream, collapse, but also laugh and sing, and call their relatives,” as </span><a href="http://kailoeffelbein.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Löffelbein</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> writes. A group of young men take a selfie after a safe landing. A father carries his daughter on the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">34-mile uphill hike from the shore to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mytilini, the island&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other images, police use tear gas against refugees protesting the conditions of the crowded Moira camp, set up in a former army barracks, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Löffelbein</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> describes as a “grim prison” where food and water is scarce. &#8220;</span>I was shocked that this refugee camp was run by almost no­ one,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;The refugees are totally left to their own resources there.&#8221; Some men climb over fences in attempt to escape riots breaking out in the days-long lines for registration. Finally, thousands of refugees gather at a port to board ferries to greater safety. Most aim to wind up in Germany.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Löffelbein&#8217;s goal is to fight ignorance and political apathy through photojournalism. &#8220;</span>As a political human being, I have to admit I don&#8217;t care if there are smarter approaches [to this kind of photography] already out there,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If a story is worth being told, then it&#8217;s better if more photographers aim to tell the story and double the audience and the coverage.&#8221; That way, he says, no one will be able to say of the refugee crisis, &#8220;Sorry, I haven&#8217;t heard about it.'&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LOS ANGELES — Just east of the LA River runs Mission Road, an industrial street crammed with auto body shops and salvage operations. I’m biking, and when the potholes thin out, I have a chance to look up. The view is dominated by the Piggyback Yard, <span style="font-weight: 400;">a Union Pacific property, and one of the more contentious development sites abutting the river. Most recently, </span><a href="http://la.curbed.com/archives/2016/01/los_angeles_2024_olympics_village_piggyback_yard_ucla_usc.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the city abandoned plans to develop it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of LA’s 2024 Olympics bid, and, for now, the yard remains a vast expanse of train tracks, shipping containers tagged with graffiti, and scraggly weeds.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m headed northeast to Lincoln Heights to meet the mural artist Alex Poli Jr., a.k.a. <a href="http://www.manone.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man  One</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whose studio sits just across the street from El Parque de Mexico. He</span> has been on the front lines of LA’s graffiti art for decades now. Born, raised, and educated in LA, he founded the Crewest Gallery in 2002, which aimed to provide artists a legitimate space to display their work during </span><a href="http://www.laweekly.com/news/carmen-trutanichs-war-on-art-murals-2172362"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LA’s 10-year mural moratorium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">h</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">l</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">l</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">r</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">r</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">d</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">y</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Crewest Gallery, which represented graffiti artists,</span> <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/14/entertainment/la-et-cm-las-crewest-gallery-to-close-after-10-years-as-graffiti-venue-20121213"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closed in 2012</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he moved into his new studio into LA’s oldest suburb, Lincoln Heights. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_270952" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270952" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_8694.jpeg" alt="IMG_8694" width="640" height="281" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_8694-291x128.jpeg 291w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_8694-768x337.jpeg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_8694-1024x449.jpeg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_8694.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Man One&#8217;s studio in Lincoln Heights</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The studio is as bright and clean as the outside is dingy, but still Man One apologizes for the mess. His long black hair is pulled back, revealing shorn sides growing out again; a goatee stands against a few days of stubble. His glasses look light enough to float away. He’s getting ready for a holiday party, and there is a lot of work strewn about. Canvases and panels are everywhere. In true LA fashion, a set of three buffed, shiny car hoods hang from the 20-foot walls with Man One’s signature use of bright colors and loopy, ghostly white figures that elongate like pieces of spaghetti.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long, relatively narrow studio is roughly divided by enormous cubbies stuffed with monographs, portfolios, coffee cans full of paintbrushes, intricately painted calaveras, and all sorts of collectibles. The rhythmic sound of sewing machines muffles through the walls. Man One tells me he’s the first non-sweatshop to be in the building for 25 years, possibly a sign of the times, or maybe just one of those LA juxtapositions, something beautiful in an endless sea of concrete and freeways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve come specifically to talk about Man One’s new mural series <em>#FacesLA</em>. The previous week I met him finishing up his second wall for the series, a portrait of a local photographer, Eriberto Oriol, whom Man One has rendered almost like a stained glass window. It sits next to a donut shop along a stretch of Echo Park Ave. His first in the series is in downtown LA, on an alley off of 8th and Flower Street. In similar blocks of color as the Oriol piece in Echo Park, the mural depicts a young boy looking to the sky. In gray outlines the word “Volar,” Spanish for “to fly,” radiates across the blackness of the wall.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_270951" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270951" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MARS.manOne_photo_v8.jpg" alt="MARS.manOne_photo_v8" width="640" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MARS.manOne_photo_v8-270x180.jpg 270w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MARS.manOne_photo_v8-768x512.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MARS.manOne_photo_v8-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MARS.manOne_photo_v8.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Finished mural with artist and subject, Eriberto Oriol</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new project is thanks to the large coalition of artists and activists, including Man One, who</span> <a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/politics/2013/08/27/14603/los-angeles-mural-moratorium-could-be-overturned/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helped end</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the mural moratorium. Lifted in 2013, there’s now a new permitting process for street art overseen by the Department of Cultural Affairs as well as one for establishing the preservation of a mural. Man </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One wanted to take advantage of his newfound status as a “legal” graffiti artist, deciding “to focus on LA and just on people who live in LA, who are born and raised in LA, who are local activists, artists, kids, grandmothers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>#FacesLA</em> is being overseen by</span><a href="http://www.muralconservancy.org/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the Mural Conservancy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and four murals have already been funded by collectors. The next is set to depict a family friend who used to own a flower shop. She was a neighborhood fixture for years, but after her son was diagnosed with ALS she closed up shop to go to nursing school in order to be his nurse. “I would love to portray and honor her in that way,” he says. The other, to go in at the </span><a href="http://www.socallib.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southern California Library for Social Studies and Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in South Los Angeles, is intended as a companion to his “</span><a href="http://www.manone.com/b4h33cgl6s2hx4wxvz3j0a85aqewif"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They Claim I’m a Criminal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” a mural at the library he painted in 2010 honoring the Coalition Against Police Abuse and Mothers ROC.</span></p>
<p>Man One hopes this is just the beginning of a larger project. He’s already in talks to execute one mural along the LA River with the help of the <a href="https://folar.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends of the LA River</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit whose mission is protecting and restoring the natural and historic heritage of the site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The river is a proverbial elephant in the city’s room, and a struggle is brewing over plans for it and adjacent properties like the Piggyback. People are already talking about it becoming LA’s riparian response to New York’s Highline, a rehabilitated locale with</span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/style/a-day-out-with-the-architect-moshe-safdie.html?_r=0"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">its own development issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “The fear is that it’s just going to be people who have no history with the river, no history with those communities around the river, [who] are just going to come exploit the whole area,” Man One explains, pointing out that</span> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-et-la-river-notebook-20150809-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank Gehry’s involvement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has put “people on alert, because now there’s money and big people are showing up to the table.” As if this wasn’t enough, this summer saw</span> <a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/06/23/52627/la-among-cities-to-receive-1m-bloomberg-public-art/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the city win a $1 million public grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Michael Bloomberg’s charity for a water-themed river biennial.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Man One, the river has been a proving ground for graffiti and mural artists for decades. He began tagging there in ’87. “As artists, that’s one of the largest canvases we’ve got in the city,” he says, stressing that “whatever happens to the river and any of these projects in the future, there has to be an element of the actual art created in the river be by Angelenos.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to worries over local input into development, community control over LA’s mural art is a growing concern for local artists like Man One. Its Southern California forms are rooted in a history that spans from Diego Rivera to the Chicano Art Movement. “I’ve always seen what we’re doing, as graffiti artists, especially from this side of town, as part of that lineage … that’s strictly LA.” One of the central features of these movements, and one essential to Man One’s current project, is the choice of subject. Rather than focus on the famous or recognizable, Chicano muralists, for example, depicted grape pickers, city laborers, people with connections to neighborhoods. Murals in LA often provide visual history lessons. They ground the viewer in the nitty-gritty of a specific location rather than call out with something instantly recognizable. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_271275" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271275" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/306303563_7591b76396_o.jpg" alt="306303563_7591b76396_o" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/306303563_7591b76396_o-240x180.jpg 240w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/306303563_7591b76396_o-768x576.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/306303563_7591b76396_o-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/306303563_7591b76396_o.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mural in East LA recalls Mexican history and forms (photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ikkoskinen/306303563/in/album-72157594392099854/" target="_blank">IK&#8217;s World Trip/Flickr</a>)</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this local tradition based on history and community is at odds with many of the new murals that seem to appear overnight. “In the Arts District you see a lot of the murals that are not based in our Chicano roots, that are more just aesthetically nice-looking pieces of work, with a very different mindset.” He assures me that he’s got nothing against such pieces, there’s plenty of space for all kinds of mural art in a city the size of LA. Nevertheless, there lies a tension between local artists and those flying in to throw up a massive piece in a weekend, then leaving. “I always want to think of my work as existing beyond a week or two weeks or a month,” he says, recalling his childhood when he enjoyed murals by the</span><a href="http://www.muralconservancy.org/artist/east-los-streetscapers"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">East Los Streetscapers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or</span> <a href="http://www.muralconservancy.org/artist/george-yepes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Yepes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A feeling of recognition was essential for the young Man One. The graffiti community’s local, site- or community-specific themes evolved and took on additional meaning as he got older, he says. “You don’t take it all in one day”; instead, “it lives with you all those years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On my way home, I start to appreciate something Man One said when we touched on the influx of artists and galleries, </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/arts/design/new-art-galleries-enjoy-a-los-angeles-advantage-space.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">especially those from New York City</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He said that outsiders typically “don’t understand how LA is organized.” They think beaches, sun, and celebrity, that the east side is anything east of Fairfax; the exact things that LA is not for most of the 13 million people who call the county home. Man One is avoiding those themes in his murals because, “what I’m trying to do with the <em>FacesLA</em> program is just show hey, there are all kinds of interesting people here. And they all make part of this fabric that we call LA.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rubble and weeds stretching towards the river have a slightly different meaning now. They remind me that when you expect a city to be a certain way, often, you end up neglecting local geography, communities, and the way they already use space. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crossing Cesar Chavez heading west, I stop to look at the river more closely. It isn’t much more than a massive storm drain — its long, concrete walls a blank canvas everyone has designs on. The eastern side is tagged with names, a few crude figures made by budding artists in their open-air studio. When I get to the western side, the walls have all been painted over.</span></p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to throw a piano or screeching cat at Le Corbusier&#8217;s pristinely white 1931 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Savoye">Villa Savoye</a> in France? <em><a href="http://theotrian.itch.io/petitarchiecte">Le Petit Architecte</a> </em>is<em> </em>a building game where you&#8217;re a young intern tasked with creating &#8220;the absolute architectural masterpiece&#8221; to &#8220;improve upon Édouard&#8217;s design&#8221; (the Swiss-French architect was born Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris). Basically, this means hurling ladders, columns, toilets, palm trees, air conditioning units, or whatever dangerous detritus comes your way into an increasingly unstable tower.</p>
<div id="attachment_266604" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-266604 size-full" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/petitarchitecte.gif" alt="Building in 'Le Petit Architect' (GIF by the author via YouTube)" width="320" height="180" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Building in &#8216;Le Petit Architect&#8217; (GIF by the author via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nG2tOD7Ts0">YouTube</a>)</p></div>
<p>UCLA student Theo Triantafyllidis made the sandbox game, available for free <a href="http://theotrian.itch.io/petitarchiecte">on Itch.io</a>, and recently shared on <a href="https://killscreen.com/articles/celebrate-swiss-architect-le-corbusier-by-defacing-one-of-his-masterpieces/">Kill Screen</a>, for the <em><a href="http://lecorbusier.arch.ntua.gr/decorbuziers">Decorbuziers</a></em> exhibition in Athens, Greece. The exhibition, which was held in December, marked the 50th year since Le Corbusier&#8217;s death. It&#8217;s an odd form of tribute, as you&#8217;re basically sneering at the <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/68491/walking-through-le-corbusiers-principles-of-architecture-in-his-villa-la-roche/">&#8220;Five Points of Architecture&#8221;</a> (except perhaps the love of supporting pillars), and building a grotesque deformity next to one of 20th-century architecture&#8217;s arguable masterpieces. The game is more <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy">Katamari Damacy</a></em> than modernist in its accumulation of increasingly bizarre objects, each with its own sound effect, into an unwieldy glob, which eventually shakes, shudders, and collapses into a tornado of debris. <em>Le Petit Architecte</em> also embraces its glitches; I found myself uncontrollably walking backwards while vaulting pianos into the distance until I fell backwards over an abyss, looking up at the Villa Savoye as I tumbled into oblivion.</p>
<p>Considering Le Corbusier&#8217;s work <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/265076/happy-new-year-here-is-the-art-entering-the-public-domain-in-2016/">went into the public domain this year</a> (in countries where copyright ends 50 years after death, so not the United States), it will be interesting to see if other creators experiment with his architectural legacy. <em>Le Petit Architecte </em>is a fairly simple game — create chaos in the face of modernist serenity. Yet it&#8217;s an enjoyably absurd diversion, and provides some digital retribution perhaps for those of us who still cringe over <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324354704578637901327433828" target="_blank">Le Corbusier&#8217;s mural defacement of Eileen Gray&#8217;s E.1027</a>.</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content">In disappointing news for those excited for a futuristic new <a href="http://www.moma.org/" target="_blank">Museum of Modern Art</a> (MoMA) with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/arts/design/a-grand-redesign-of-moma-does-not-spare-a-notable-neighbor.html" target="_blank">retractable glass walls and moving floors</a>, the museum has just unveiled scaled-back plans for its upcoming renovation.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content">In response to criticism, MoMA and architectural firm <a href="http://www.dsrny.com/" target="_blank">Diller Scofidio + Renfro</a> have eliminated the flashiest elements of the redesign plans. They&#8217;ve opted against building a fourth-floor “Gray Box,” a hybrid whitebox gallery/blackbox theater with an interior visible from the street, which would let passersby peer up at performance art. They&#8217;ve also scrapped the street-facing public entrance to the sculpture garden on 54th Street.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content">Despite these cutbacks, the expansion will still come with a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/arts/design/moma-trims-back-some-features-of-its-planned-renovation.html?ref=arts&amp;_r=2" target="_blank">$390 to $400 million price tag</a>, according to the first official cost estimate. Another $40 million or more will go towards renovating existing galleries. Construction on the expansion will begin in February, two years after the initial announcement of the redesign.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content">The expansion will add about 50,000 square feet of new gallery space to the Museum. Once the renovation is complete, in 2019 or 2020, the Museum will have a total of 174,000 of square feet of gallery space, an increase of 30%. Much of this will be built in the neighboring space formerly occupied by the American Folk Art Museum, which MoMA controversially <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/arts/design/architects-mourn-former-folk-art-museum-building.html" target="_blank">demolished</a> in 2014, and in the lower levels of Jean Nouvel&#8217;s <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/32190/ny-observer-digs-up-momas-new-tower-design/" target="_blank">Tower Verre skyscraper</a>, which is currently under construction in the adjacent lot.</p>
<div id="attachment_271187" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271187" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MoMA-Axonometric-JAN16.jpg" alt="16_0113_AXON_BASE" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MoMA-Axonometric-JAN16-240x180.jpg 240w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MoMA-Axonometric-JAN16-768x576.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MoMA-Axonometric-JAN16-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MoMA-Axonometric-JAN16.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A rendering of the planned layout (image courtesy of the Museum of Modern Art)</p></div>
<p class="story-body-text story-content">Instead of going for a museum-of-the-future/modern art theme park aesthetic, the redesign will focus on making the space work better for visitors and curators. “This is not a heroic ‘Ta-da!’” Elizabeth Diller of Diller Scofidio &amp; Renfro, the design firm revising the building, told the <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/arts/design/moma-trims-back-some-features-of-its-planned-renovation.html?ref=arts&amp;_r=2" target="_blank">New York Times</a></em>. &#8220;It’s careful. Surgical.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content">To make for a less congested lobby, the redesign will move the currently street-level MoMA Store below ground. An additional retail space will be added to the second floor to make up for the drop in retail revenue the store&#8217;s relocation will likely cause. The new below-ground store will have a cutaway ceiling, letting visitors peer down from the lobby and the street.</p>
<div id="attachment_271310" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271310" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7275093184_05bcc29769_h.jpg" alt="7275093184_05bcc29769_h" width="640" height="491" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7275093184_05bcc29769_h-235x180.jpg 235w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7275093184_05bcc29769_h-768x589.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7275093184_05bcc29769_h-1024x786.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7275093184_05bcc29769_h.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Bauhaus Staircase at MoMA (photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ru_boff/7275093184/in/photolist-c5SKK7-S2aDD-ybAJw-9iC1Y-qyDWr9-7KZtD6-7cyvig-6VrDUQ-5o74Q">Dimitry B./Flickr</a>)</p></div>
<p class="story-body-text story-content">Other significant planned changes: a new lounge; the removal of a wall blocking a view of the garden; the replacement of the 1939 black terrazzo Bauhaus Stair, partially removed in an earlier renovation; and a makeover of the notoriously slow coat check line.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content">The final architectural design won&#8217;t be announced until later this year. The construction will take place in three phases, so the museum will remain open throughout, with individual galleries closed during renovation. It could, however, close for several months after completion in order for staff to rehang the collection.</p>

<p>Ai Weiwei has withdrawn his art from two museums in Denmark to protest a law passed yesterday by the Danish parliament viewed by many as an anti-immigration measure. As he shared on his Instagram, the Chinese dissident artist has closed his solo exhibition <em><a href="http://www.faurschou.com/copenhagen/ai-weiwei-ruptures/installation-views-of-exhibition-ai-weiwei-ruptures-3" target="_blank">Ruptures</a></em> at Copenhagen&#8217;s Faurschou Foundation and retracted an installation from <em><a href="http://www.aros.dk/besoeg-aros/udstillinger/2015/a-new-dynasty-%E2%80%93-created-in-china/" target="_blank">A New Dynasty — Created in China</a></em>, a group show of Chinese artists at the ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum in Aarhus. The withdrawals respond directly to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/world/europe/denmark-asks-refugees-for-valuables.html" target="_blank">approval</a> of a proposed law stipulating that asylum seekers must now surrender their valuables as recompense for refuge in Denmark. The regulation also delays any family reunions for refugees, stating that they must wait three years before they may even begin the application process of bringing their families over to the Scandinavian country.</p>
<p>Ai announced his exit from the ARoS show first, in an apologetic open letter to its curators Feng Boyi and <span class="goog-text-highlight">Erlend G. Høyersten, who serves as the museum&#8217;s director. Translated from Chinese, it <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BBB1se3KD2K/" target="_blank">reads</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>I am very shocked about yesterday’s news that the Danish government has decided to seize refugees’ private property. As a result of this regrettable decision, I must withdraw from your exhibition ‘A New Dynasty  – Created In China’ to express my protest of the Danish governments’ decision. Please accept my regrets and thank you for your long-term support. I apologize for the inconvenience caused.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 2015 work, titled &#8220;Yu Yi,&#8221; depicts a figure made of bamboo that spans nearly 40 feet and hangs from the ceiling to suspend 26 feet above viewers. According to the museum, it references a funerary ornament made of jade from the Han Dynasty as well as &#8220;a flying superman referring directly to China as the ultimate world superpower.&#8221; Also featured in the exhibition, intended to present views of China from its own artists&#8217; perspectives, are works by Xu Bing, Yin Xiuzhen, and Maleonn. The show, which opened in November, is set to run through May.</p>

<p>The contemporary art museum also <a href="http://en.aros.dk/about-aros/press/2016/ai-weiwei-withdraws-installation/" target="_blank">announced</a> the news on its website along with the following statement from Høyersten:</p>
<blockquote><p>We don’t as yet have all the facts in place and we await further details. Needless to say, we’re somewhat taken aback. We’re an art museum that on a daily basis strives to achieve a better understanding for human relations, greater insight into cultures, and we welcome critical reflection based on art. Hence we subscribe to many of the same values as Ai Weiwei.</p>
<p>At this very moment in time, and more than ever before, the people of Europe need cultural institutions to allow space for free thoughts and words. ARoS is an independent institution whose programmes and exhibitions are in no way governed by the power élite as is the case in China, for example. While I profoundly respect his reaction to Danish refugee policy, I think it unreasonable that an entire country and its people should be punished as a result of government policies.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the Faurschou Foundation, the situation was different, with the museum supporting Ai, working with him to take a stance against the controversial passage. Shortly after announcing his withdrawal from the ARoS museum, Ai shared an image of him and the Foundation&#8217;s owner Jens Faurschou. The caption announced the artist&#8217;s intention to cut short his exhibition, previously scheduled to remain open through April. The Foundation issued a <a href="http://www.faurschou.com/copenhagen" target="_blank">similar statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-reactid=".0.1.0.0.0.2.1.0.0.1"><span data-reactid=".0.1.0.0.0.2.1.0.0.1.3">Jens Faurschou backs the artist’s decision and regrets that the Danish parliament choses to be in the forefront of symbolic and inhuman politics of todays biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe and the Middle East, instead of being in the forefront of a respectful European solution to solve the acute humanitarian crisis.</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Unlike Høyersten, Faurschou was not surprised when Ai called him to announce his intentions, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/27/ai-weiwei-shuts-danish-show-in-protest-at-asylum-seeker-law" target="_blank">according</a> to <em>the Guardian</em>.</p>
<p>“From Ai Weiwei’s side, the important thing is to get a debate and to use his voice,” the Danish art collector said. “He is becoming a European; he is taking part in what goes on here. He did that in China. People would say he has no influence, but when he focused on the scandal of the earthquake in 2008, today China is doing something about corruption. He has a voice and he uses it. I really admire him for that.”</p>
<p>To further criticize the Danish government, Ai later posted a photograph of the luminescent advertisement at Copenhagen airport&#8217;s arrival hall that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BBCp84zKD10/" target="_blank">reads</a>, &#8220;Welcome to the world&#8217;s happiest nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ai&#8217;s withdrawal from the two museums represents the latest action in the artist&#8217;s addressing of the European refugee crisis. Previously, he has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/17/ai-weiwei-anish-kapoor-london-walk-refugees" target="_blank">marched in London</a> (alongside Anish Kapoor) to demonstrate solidarity with refugees and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/world/europe/ai-weiweis-instagram-dispatches-from-lesbos-greek-island-at-center-of-migrant-crisis.html" target="_blank">met with others</a> displaced on the Greek island of Lesbos, where he met with refugees and recently <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/01/ai-weiwei-sets-up-studio-on-greek-island-of-lesbos-to-highlight-plight-of-refugees" target="_blank">established</a> a studio to raise awareness about their plight. It&#8217;s reassuring to know that even though he&#8217;s <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/270623/paris-department-store-kite-display-marks-new-low-for-ai-weiwei/" target="_blank">busy</a> embellishing department stores and posing with high-heeled socialites, he still has the time to confront more pressing issues around the world.</p>

<p>DETROIT — Michigan kicked off 2016 with all kinds of breaking litigation news. Leading the pack, before the <a href="http://motorcitymuckraker.com/2016/01/21/5-disturbing-revelations-from-gov-snyders-e-mails-about-flint-water-crisis/5/" target="_blank">horrific revelations</a> of Flint’s water crisis and the <a href="http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2016/01/25/dps-hearing/79250198/" target="_blank">Detroit Public School shutdown</a>, artist Katherine Craig <a href="http://www.citylab.com/design/2016/01/artist-sues-to-save-her-landmark-detroit-mural/422523/" target="_blank">filed suit</a> in US District Court in Detroit against Princeton Enterprises, the owner of a building at 2937 East Grand Boulevard that hosts her 2009 public artwork “The Illuminated Mural.” The building <a href="http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20150603/BLOG016/150609942/building-with-bleeding-rainbow-mural-in-milwaukee-junction-up-for" target="_blank">went up for auction</a> last summer and was purchased by Princeton Enterprises with the intention of redeveloping it as multifamily or loft housing — a project that would potentially threaten or outright destroy Craig’s artwork. Craig is seeking an injunction against actions by the developer that would compromise or destroy her iconic mural, which is comprised of 100-plus gallons of paint and is a signature piece in her oeuvre.</p>
<p>Her suit epitomizes one of the fundamental tensions of the use of art as a spearhead for gentrification: developers are more than happy to accommodate artists when their interventions bring new interest and value to properties or neighborhoods — and Craig’s mural has inarguably become one of Detroit’s best-loved works of public art — but once these holdings have sufficiently appreciated, little consideration is paid to the sweat, material, and professional equity that went into the works, from both the artists and surrounding communities. In a conversation with Hyperallergic, Amy Keller, part of Craig’s legal team at Wexler Wallace LLP, pointed out that this is not strictly an issue in Detroit: one of Chicago’s most cherished public murals, William Walker’s “<a href="http://www.chicagopublicartgroup.org/all-of-mankind" target="_blank">All of Mankind</a>,” was <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/schmich/ct-walker-church-mural-schmich-met-1220-20151218-column.html" target="_blank">unceremoniously whitewashed</a> off the face of the Strangers Home Missionary Baptist Church in December to pave the way for a development deal.</p>
<p>“I grew up just outside of Detroit,&#8221; said Keller. &#8220;Witnessing its redevelopment over the past few years has been incredibly exciting. Just like any city, responsible and mindful development is paramount to ensuring good community relations. This is especially important when redeveloping a neighborhood, as developers should respect the rights of current residents, businesses, and artists who have shaped the fabric of those communities.”</p>
<p>Craig took time out for an interview with Hyperallergic over email, discussing some of the ins and outs of her situation.</p>

<p><strong>Sarah Rose Sharp: </strong><em>Can you give me a bit of background on the creation of “The Illuminated Mural”? Was it commissioned? </em></p>
<p><strong>Katherine Craig:</strong> In 2009 I was awarded a <a href="http://www.collegeforcreativestudies.edu/community-outreach-and-engagement/community-public-arts-detroit">community+public arts:Detroit</a> (CPAD) grant, chosen from among a roster of 50 artists selected by the North End community. This means “The Illuminated Mural” was a noncommissioned work but received community support from the very beginning. As part of the competitive proposal process, which required the work to be highly visible, I conceptualized “The Illuminated Mural,” prepared drawings, and secured a location.</p>
<p>After winning the grant, I began planning for a major, long-lasting project. I secured insurance, purchased materials, and arranged for equipment, including the lifts that were on-site for two weeks. So much went in to this artwork: I had to paint nonstop, sometimes even throughout the night. I used industrial painting methods and worked to make sure that the mural would survive. I applied a protective coating on the work, harnessing myself on to the lift and spraying the mural with two solid coats of ultraviolet protection. It was a test of endurance.</p>
<p>But it was also an amazing opportunity to make my mark on the city and its arts scene — for example, I also used the mural as a home base to launch <a href="http://northendstudios.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">North End Studios</a>, a space for local artists within 2937 East Grand Boulevard, the site of the mural.</p>
<p><strong>SRS: </strong><em>How did the surrounding community receive the piece, initially and over time? </em></p>
<p><strong>KC:</strong> The response of the community was inspiring. The community praised the mural, and people who knew I had a studio in the building would stop by just to take photos of the work. I attended many community meetings while creating the mural, informing neighbors of my progress and making sure they understood the plans. I remember particularly the excitement, especially from the young people I worked with, at one of my last required community meetings. Since the mural was finished, community groups have hired me to teach classes on mural art in the North End and funded more of my projects.</p>
<p>Beyond the immediate community, I received attention locally, nationally, and internationally for the work. It’s been featured in music videos, on television, and in film documentaries. “The Illuminated Mural” created an economy for my work, and I was able to use it as a bridge to my graduate program. More broadly, I’ve been proud to be part of a moment of resurgence of mural art in Detroit.</p>
<div id="attachment_271243" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IlluminatedMural1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-271243" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IlluminatedMural1.jpg" alt="Katherine Craig's &quot;The Illuminated Mural&quot; on the side of 2937 East Grand Boulevard in Detroit (all images courtesy the artist)" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IlluminatedMural1-271x180.jpg 271w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IlluminatedMural1-768x511.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IlluminatedMural1-1024x681.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IlluminatedMural1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Katherine Craig&#8217;s &#8220;The Illuminated Mural&#8221; on the side of 2937 East Grand Boulevard in Detroit (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p><strong>SRS: </strong><em>I am interested in the idea that in contributing art to a neighborhood, an artist is given a stake in the equity of the building where their work is located. Too often, the work of artists paves the way for developers, but as the spaces they have altered increase in value, their work is destroyed. Can you speak to your experience of this process, and what it means for you emotionally and professionally to have an important work at risk of destruction?</em></p>
<p><strong>KC:</strong> People often don’t realize how much investment goes into art. “The Illuminated Mural” reflects the time, effort, and money I’ve put into my career — most obviously, a bachelor’s degree from the College for Creative Studies and a master’s degree in sculpture from the Cranbrook Academy of Art. I was young, 25, when I painted this work, and it was a major turning point in my career.</p>
<p>I’ve capitalized on the mural’s existence, and it’s not surprising that other people have found ways to do the same. The building is a local landmark, and I know the mural could be something that stands out in the mind of potential buyers. 2937 East Grand Boulevard is now the “Illuminated Mural” building, and this could attract potential developers to the site. The possibility that my work could be destroyed as a result is extremely frustrating. Art can be a major force for good in a city, but I worry that developers and the larger forces of gentrification often exploit it.</p>
<p>And personally and professionally, the threat of having my work removed poses many obstacles. As a direct result of the mural’s reputation, I’m currently included in a new CPAD roster, which other neighborhoods can use when choosing artists for future projects. “The Illuminated Mural” is a central part of my livelihood, and I would be devastated to see it destroyed.</p>
<p>I believe that public art and urbanism go hand in hand. There should be <em>more</em> art in Detroit. But that can’t happen unless we protect the rights of artists.</p>
<p><strong>SRS: </strong><em>What is the ideal outcome in this scenario, as you see it?</em></p>
<p><strong>KC:</strong> I’ll leave this one for my lawyers, except to say that I hope to prevent the destruction of the mural and set a precedent for other cases.</p>

<p>LOS ANGELES — “Do you have any treats? Put all your treats in the bucket. Absolutely no treats inside the theater,” a woman declared as we waited in line outside <a href="http://www.cinefamily.org/" target="_blank">The Cinefamily</a>, an independent movie theater located next to Canter’s Deli on Fairfax. My wife and I had come with our dog Ollie to see <em><a href="http://www.cinefamily.org/concert-for-dogs-heart-of-a-dog-w-laurie-anderson/" target="_blank">Heart of a Dog</a></em>, a new film by artist and musician Laurie Anderson. This was not just any old screening — viewers were allowed to bring their pups, and Anderson would be performing a short concert specifically tailored to canines before the film.</p>
<p>With dozens of dogs occupying the theater&#8217;s narrow aisles, Cinefamily staff wanted to make sure everything went smoothly, hence the confiscation of dog treats, which presumably would add unnecessary excitement to an already charged atmosphere. “You’ll get them back when you leave,” she reassured us, as I took a handful of Charlee Bear snacks out of my pocket and dumped them in the contraband bucket.</p>
<div id="attachment_270817" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270817" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9088.jpg" alt="Nicole and Freeway Doggins" width="640" height="854" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9088-135x180.jpg 135w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9088-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9088.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Nicole and Freeway Doggins</p></div>
<p>We were led through the theater to an outdoor back patio where other dogs and their owners were milling about. The humans talked about the two highlights of the event: Laurie Anderson and dogs (mostly the dogs). I met Freeway Doggins and his owner Nicole, who found him on the side of the 101. I also met Tango, a poodle mix, who was an old hand at this, having attended the Puppy Bowl here last year.</p>
<div id="attachment_270818" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270818" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9129.jpg" alt="Maggie and Gigi" width="640" height="927" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9129-768x1112.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9129-707x1024.jpg 707w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9129.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Maggie and Gigi</p></div>
<p>Serendipitously, I ran into Maggie, an old college friend I hadn’t seen in at least 15 years. She&#8217;d gotten her dog Gigi four years ago after moving from New York to L.A. “I was a mess, no one talked to me here,&#8221; she told me. &#8220;So I decided to get a dog.” A creative director by day, in her spare time she makes sculptures of people’s pets out of wool, with their actual fur woven in.</p>
<div id="attachment_270819" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270819" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9136.jpg" alt="David, Lori and Nicholas von Flue" width="640" height="889" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9136-768x1067.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9136-737x1024.jpg 737w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9136.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">David, Lori, and Nicholas von Flue</p></div>
<p>Most of the dogs were rescued mutts, but a few bore purebred pedigrees, like Nicholas von Flue, a Bernese named after the Swiss saint, whose owners had traveled all the way to Albuquerque to get him.</p>
<p>After a quick meet-and-greet with Anderson, during which she graciously posed with people’s dogs for photos, we were herded into the theater, a carefully orchestrated procession that recalled the loading of Noah&#8217;s Arc but crossed with a red carpet event. “We&#8217;re ready for the large dogs, now, large dogs, please, follow me!” a staff member ordered, trying to get everyone into the theater as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
<div id="attachment_270813" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270813" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9158.jpg" alt="Susanna, Jurka, and Albert" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9158-240x180.jpg 240w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9158-768x576.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9158-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9158.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Susanna, Jurka, and Albert</p></div>
<p>Once the dogs were seated (big dogs on the couches in front; smaller ones on laps), Anderson, standing behind a small keyboard and voice modulator, began her set. I wasn’t sure the dogs would like the music, or even care, but as soon as the saxophonist started to eke out some high-pitched, skronky notes, Ollie’s ears perked up and he was transfixed. During one song, the band members themselves started barking, encouraging the dogs to join them as collaborators. Most of pups happily obliged, but not Ollie — he just looked around at the others like they were all crazy.</p>
<div id="attachment_270820" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270820" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9190-e1453781202290.jpg" alt="Laurie Anderson's Concert for Dogs" width="640" height="413" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Laurie Anderson&#8217;s Concert for Dogs</p></div>
<p>Anderson’s <em>Heart of a Dog</em> is ostensibly about the loss of her beloved rat terrier Lolabelle, but is actually much broader, using her story to explore themes of loss and letting go, memory and narrative. “The things in the film are from my life, however, this is not a film about me and my dog,” Anderson said in a talk after the screening. “It’s about trying to make a kind of conversation with people, filled with questions like: ‘What do you want? Where are you going?’ It’s about other things along the way.”</p>
<p><em>Heart of a Dog</em> is an essayistic film, in the tradition of Chris Marker, jumping back and forth between Anderson&#8217;s intimate relationship with Lolabelle and many other, seemingly unrelated threads that branch off like tangents: the post 9/11 national security apparatus, the Tibetan book of the Dead, childhood recollections of almost accidentally drowning her twin brothers in an icy lake. We see Lolabelle’s decline, including a scene of her banging out Thelonious Monk–like patterns on the piano, which she began to play when she lost her sight. “When she went blind she didn&#8217;t do well,” Anderson recalled. “She would not move. She panicked. I didn&#8217;t necessarily want a piano-playing dog, but the point of this was to make a world that she could control. Music saved her life. A lot of musicians would say that.” Throughout it all, Anderson is our constant guide via voiceover. She has the perfect tone for speaking to dogs: calm and gentle, yet deliberate.</p>
<div id="attachment_270821" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270821" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9225.jpg" alt="Laurie Anderson" width="640" height="864" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9225-768x1037.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9225-759x1024.jpg 759w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9225.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Laurie Anderson</p></div>
<p>The film returns to Buddhism several times, and one of its main sections is dedicated to Anderson’s imagining of Lolabelle’s trip through the Bardo, the 49-day period of transition after death that is central to Tibetan Buddhism. Anderson references the Buddhist idea of “learn to feel sad without being sad,” which helped her through not only the loss of Lolabelle, but also that of her husband Lou Reed, who passed away in 2013, two years after Lola. Reed is only in the film briefly, but his song &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQahAkaSpz4" target="_blank">Turning Time Around</a>&#8221; provides an elegiac finale. “The thing that attracts me to Buddhism is the same as making art for me,” she said. “It doesn’t come with any set of rules about what’s good or bad. They share a single thing, which is basically: pay attention. That’s all it is.”</p>
<p>Anderson’s biggest challenge when making the film was finding a way to bind all its disparate elements together. “The hardest part for me was getting a progression. There has to be an engine pushing through,” she told the audience. “I made mine out of questions to you, asked over and over without answering them. I wanted something very ragged that would leave a lot of room for you to take what you would from it.</p>
<p>“I don’t know about your life,” she confided “but mine does not have a plot. Things just happen.”</p>

<p>A pair of site-specific murals by <a href="http://www.dorothearockburne.com/" target="_blank">Dorothea Rockburne</a> that for two years seemed destined for removal or even destruction by a real estate group may now remain in their home of over two decades, the iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Tower" target="_blank">Sony Tower</a> designed by Phillip Johnson. The paintings, commissioned in 1993 specifically for the lobby of what was once Sony&#8217;s headquarters, now belong to the Chetrit Group, which acquired the skyscraper at 550 Madison Avenue in 2013 and plans to transform it into luxury apartments. Since their sealing of the $1.1 billion deal, the developers have largely been ignoring Rockburne&#8217;s attempts to learn the fate of her artworks but today finally agreed to discuss their preservation with her in person, Hyperallergic has learned.</p>
<p>On February 9, Rockburne will meet with developers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Chetrit" target="_blank">Joseph</a> and Jonathan Chetrit (respectively, father and son) as well as the building&#8217;s new architect, Robert A. M. Stern, to discuss how to either preserve the fresco-secco works in situ or move them to an interested museum. The forthcoming meeting was organized by Jonathan himself, likely in response to pressure from the <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/01/24/famed-artists-murals-may-end-up-in-midtown-trash-heap/" target="_blank">airing</a> of Rockburne&#8217;s concerns in the news earlier this week.</p>

<p>As Rockburne told Hyperallergic, Jonathan called her studio this morning, telling the artist she had &#8220;nothing to worry about&#8221; in regards to her paintings.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounded like they planned to do everything to cooperate,&#8221; Rockburne said, adding that she intends to make sure the murals are properly lit and their damaged areas restored if the developers do agree to keep them in the building.</p>
<p>Chetrit also told Rockburne that her two years of attempts at correspondence were &#8220;miscommunication,&#8221; telling her he thought Sony had been in touch with her all this time. The company sent her a letter in 2013 notifying her of the building’s sale, but Rockburne says it did not discuss the murals’ fate, as Sony no longer had legal responsibility over them. For her part, Rockburne shrugged off Chetrit’s excuses, focusing instead on receiving encouraging news.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure, in a certain way, it&#8217;s a case of busy lives,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you, I&#8217;m like walking three feet above the floor here. I&#8217;ve been ready to fight like hell, I was ready to go to war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spanning 30 by 30 feet, Rockburne&#8217;s &#8220;Northern Sky&#8221; and &#8220;Southern Sky&#8221; were commissioned for the Sony Tower in 1993 by Michael Schulhof, former CEO of Sony America. Schulhof called Rockburne last night, the artist said, emphasizing that he would do whatever he could to help the paintings find their way into a museum&#8217;s collection. After today&#8217;s phone call, Rockburne is hopeful that the Chetrits will allow her vibrant works to remain in the updated lobby, emphasizing that that space is their rightful home.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is actually a very site-specific work,&#8221; Rockburne told Hyperallergic. &#8220;It is about the electromagnetic field in that particular part of the sky, so it would be sad to move it, even though a museum would be a good place for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rockburne has been trying to save her murals for two years, steadily sending letters to the Chetrits. Last July, she hired <a href="http://theartlawblog.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Donn Zaretsky</a>, who runs the Art Law Blog; he called the real estate group multiple times on her behalf, to no avail. In December, she sent a press package containing the details of her correspondence to the Chetrit Group, warning them that if she did not hear back by mid January she would go to the press — a tactic that has evidently proven successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m just elated because for two years my heart has been in my throat about it,&#8221; Rockburne told Hyperallergic. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to save my child every which way I knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Rockburne&#8217;s murals may be saved, this isn&#8217;t the first time the Chetrit Group has found itself at odds with the art world. In 2011, after the developers purchased the Chelsea Hotel, all the art it housed <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/48521/larry-rivers-foundation-joins-fight-to-find-chelsea-hotel-art/" target="_blank">mysteriously disappeared</a>, with two works appearing in a pile of garbage. The Larry Rivers Foundation, which spearheaded a hunt, later sued the Chetrit Group over a painting, though the developers steadfastly remained silent about the situation. Most recently, Joseph Chetrit purchased a property in the South Bronx along with fellow developer Keith Rubenstein, who last November threw a <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/246039/what-will-become-of-the-south-bronx/" target="_blank">tasteless rager</a> at the soon-to-be demolished warehouse, curated by artist Lucien Smith.</p>
<p>Hyperallergic has reached out to the Chetrit Group multiple times for comment but has not received a response.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_270504" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270504" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bullet-hole-horse.jpg" alt="Piers Secunda, &quot;ISIS Bullet Hole Painting (Assyrian Horse)&quot; (2015)" width="640" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bullet-hole-horse-270x180.jpg 270w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bullet-hole-horse-768x512.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bullet-hole-horse.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Piers Secunda, &#8220;ISIS Bullet Hole Painting (Assyrian Horse)&#8221; (2015) (all images courtesy The Missing unless otherwise noted)</p></div>
<p>In the past year alone, members of ISIS have marred cultural treasures in Iraq and Syria, taking <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/185964/isis-destroys-mosul-museum-collection-and-ancient-assyrian-statues/" target="_blank">sledgehammers and drills</a> to statues at the Mosul Museum and delivering <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/tag/palmyra/" target="_blank">numerous blows</a> to the ancient site of Palmyra, including its 1,800-year-old Arch of Triumph. With no end to such relentless destruction in sight — unfortunately, the savagery seems to only grow — the documentation and preservation of such artifacts of cultural heritage have become duties we must approach with a sense of urgency.</p>
<div id="attachment_270505" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/king.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-270505" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/king.jpg" alt="Morehshin Allahyari, &quot;Material Speculation: ISIS, Unknown King of Hatra&quot; (2015) (photo by the author for Hyperallergic) (click to enlarge) " width="320" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/king-135x180.jpg 135w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/king-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/king.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Morehshin Allahyari, &#8220;Material Speculation: ISIS, Unknown King of Hatra&#8221; (2015) (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>A number of projects that engage with existing and developing technologies have emerged in recent years to trace the histories of and even reconstruct destroyed objects. While many of these respond to cultural loss from human conflict, still others are concerned with ever-present sources and causes of erasure, from looting and illicit resales to weather and the passing of time. <em><a href="http://johnjay.jjay.cuny.edu/acalendar/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&amp;eventidn=8597&amp;information_id=23515&amp;type=&amp;syndicate=syndicate" target="_blank">The Missing: Rebuilding the Past</a></em>, a group exhibition at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, examines<strong> </strong>how artists<strong> </strong>use creative means to protest preventable loss. While many of the works on view engage specifically with ongoing destruction in conflict zones such as those in Iraq and Syria, the exhibit also explores projects focused on other regions that make us consider broader issues of cultural disappearance.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most well-known of reconstruction projects is one that responds directly to last February&#8217;s wrecking of the Mosul Museum: <em><a href="http://www.morehshin.com/2015/05/25/material-speculation-isis/" target="_blank">Material Speculation: ISIS</a></em>, Iranian artist <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/146368/a-new-media-artist-looks-to-iranian-spam/" target="_blank">Morehshin Allahyari</a>&#8216;s ongoing series of 3D-printed objects<em>. </em>For almost a year, Allahyari has been researching a number of the museum&#8217;s destroyed artifacts — a painstaking effort, as relevant documents she found were often ill-translated, and the museum lacked sufficient funds to completely photograph its collection. On view as part of <em>The Missing</em> is an approximately one-foot-tall representation of a life-size sculpture of King Uthal, <a href="https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-2-the-sculptures-from-hatra/" target="_blank">known as</a> &#8220;the finest of all the sculptures unearthed in Hatra.&#8221; Inside the figurine resides a USB drive and memory card, onto which Allahyari loaded images, maps, videos, and PDF files representing all the research she found on the original object. The comprehensive and sturdy packaging stands in stark contrast to sculptures of a carving fragmented by ISIS bullet holes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_GxAEolruo&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">cast</a> in Iraq by Piers Secunda. While Secunda provides glaring evidence of the violence of war, Allahyari&#8217;s work looks towards the future; she is now seeking an institution that is able to preserve the data in a digital archive to provide open access to all this information so others may construct their own 3D models. To her, even that act would be one of resistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The copy is actually making it more and more powerful every time you have a new 3D print of it,&#8221; Allahyari noted, speaking recently at a <a href="http://johnjay.jjay.cuny.edu/acalendar/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&amp;eventidn=8715&amp;information_id=23804&amp;type=&amp;syndicate=syndicate" target="_blank">symposium on the future of digital archaeology</a> held in conjunction with the exhibition. &#8220;Every time you save that file on your computer and keep it in a digital archive, you have somehow fought against the removal of that history.”</p>
<div id="attachment_270517" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270517" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/million.jpg" alt="Digital 3D Rendering of Bel Temple Arch, Palmyra, Syria (2015) captured by Million Image Database (Oxford Institute of Digital Archaeology)" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/million-240x180.jpg 240w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/million-768x576.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/million-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/million.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Digital 3D Rendering of Bel Temple Arch, Palmyra, Syria (2015) captured by Million Image Database (Oxford Institute of Digital Archaeology)</p></div>
<p><em>The Missing</em> spotlights a number of existing online libraries attempting to safeguard heritage sites and objects. On display is a 3D rendering of an arch from the <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/233275/isis-sets-off-explosion-in-most-important-temple-in-syria/" target="_blank">pulverized Temple of Bel</a> — one example of the works the <a href="http://digitalarchaeology.org.uk/projects/" target="_blank">Million Image Database</a> has created from the combined efforts of its volunteer photographers scattered across countries, including Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Egypt. These volunteers are armed with low-cost, easy-to-use cameras that capture stereoscopic images and automatically upload them to an open-source database. With the millions of 3D images amassed, the program intends to replicate full-scale models of at-risk artifacts. The Palmyra arch will be its first replication, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/28/palmyra-temple-bel-arch-survived-isis-syria-london-new-york" target="_blank">landing</a> this April in Times Square and Trafalgar Square. In a similar vein, albeit on a broader scale, the non-profit <a href="http://www.cyark.org/about/" target="_blank">CyARK</a> has been collecting 3D images of significant sites around the world — from the Brandenburg Gate to China&#8217;s Eastern Qing Tombs — some of which are featured in the gallery. Unlike most of the projects represented, this endeavor is one that anticipates threat, representing a broad concern to preserve history even in regions void of conflict.</p>
<p>One of the most poignant expressions of preservation in the exhibit actually comes from one of the smallest-scale projects that is currently <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/6b4q5z94" target="_blank">seeking funding</a> via GoFundMe. The in-progress digital 3D model of a theater in Palmyra was created by archaeologist Conan Parsons and is part of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Palmyra3Dmodel/timeline" target="_blank">Palmyra Photogrammetry</a>, his project that crowdsources unaltered holiday photos that feature the ancient ruins from different angles to eventually build a 3D model of the city. The image&#8217;s surface ripples as if painted with watercolors or as though the building were melting. This distortion stems from its incompletion, reminding of the large efforts required to properly reconstruct the missing: the image needs many, many more two-dimensional images to stitch together a precise 3D visual.</p>
<div id="attachment_270516" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270516" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/palmyra-theater-.jpg" alt="Palmyra Photogrammetry (Conan Parsons), &quot;Digital 3D model of Theater, Palmyra, Syria (in-progress) (2015)" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/palmyra-theater--240x180.jpg 240w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/palmyra-theater--768x576.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/palmyra-theater--1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/palmyra-theater-.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Palmyra Photogrammetry (Conan Parsons), &#8220;Digital 3D model of Theater, Palmyra, Syria (in-progress) (2015)</p></div>
<p>Such endeavors demonstrate how technologies — especially optic-based ones — are popular weapons for resistance, but as ISIS&#8217;s <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/196714/sleek-new-video-shows-isis-destroying-ancient-city-of-hatra/" target="_blank">propaganda videos prove</a>, those responsible for destruction also take full advantage of such tools. Through her collection of digital prints showing looted antiquities sold online, professor of art crime <a href="http://www.artcrimeprof.com/" target="_blank">Erin Thompson</a> presents the digital networks that support the disappearance of culture; at the same time, however, the pictures reveal how the very use of such systems also undermines these criminal acts. Taken by middlemen, these photographs were shared with potential buyers over social media networking sites from Facebook to Whatsapp, unintentionally providing crime investigators like Thompson with traces of the looted object&#8217;s history. Such images may eventually be matched with objects with falsified paperwork, with many offering evidence that their subjects were stolen: clear markers are items found in frames, from a carelessly left metal detector to a pack of cigarettes intended to show scale.</p>

<p>Looking to the past, a number of artworks engage with objects already preserved in museums to consider how we perceive relatively long-damaged works. Photographs by <a href="http://www.dimitraermeidou.com/" target="_blank">Dimitra Ermeidou</a>, for instance, show ruined, ancient Greek reliefs at the National Archaeological Museum, while graphite drawings by <a href="http://www.gailrothschild.com/" target="_blank">Gail Rothschild</a> zoom in on the cracks of Assyrian relief panels from the palace of Ashurnasirpal II at Nimrud, covered up in many museums but left in their scarred state at the Brooklyn Museum. Photographs by <a href="https://chronisspanos.com/" target="_blank">Chronis Spanos</a> that pair unaltered and kaleidoscopic perspectives of the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum make us revisit the highly familiar in foreign reconfigurations. Placed alongside homages to objects recently damaged or obliterated, these three works highlight ancient artworks we may overlook simply because of their established presence in museums. They make us reflect on the context in which they entered collections in the first place and how their wounds influence judgments of beauty and value.</p>
<p>Rothschild&#8217;s devoted illustrations to Nimrud are especially stirring when one considers that the world recently lost the original reliefs left in situ, destroyed when ISIS fighters <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/198640/isis-video-shows-devastating-destruction-of-ancient-assyrias-capital/" target="_blank">barrel-bombed</a> the ancient city last March. The virtual reality experience &#8220;<a href="http://www.learningsites.com/Frame_layout01.htm" target="_blank">Nimrud Rising</a>&#8221; exemplifies the necessity of documenting such significant sites: the project began nearly two decades ago and now stands as one of the most elaborately reconstructed representations of a now-lost treasure. Although not directly included in <em>The Missing</em>, <strong>its</strong> beta version made its debut at the symposium, presented by its scientific director Donald Sanders of <a href="http://www.learningsites.com/" target="_blank">Learning Sites, Inc</a> and its executive producer Peter Herdrich of the <a href="https://theantiquitiescoalition.org/" target="_blank">Antiquities Coalition</a>. Users, wearing an Oculus Rift, may roam around the palace&#8217;s interior and exterior as seen during the Assyrian Empire, with every detail rendered with incredible precision. One may walk up to a wall and examine its reliefs, for instance, or observe the carvings of large Lamassu. Sanders and Herdrich intend for &#8220;Nimrud Rising&#8221; to be a teaching tool that may be mass-distributed, especially since the Oculus Rift <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/268442/the-virtual-reality-future-is-here/" target="_blank">hits the consumer market</a> this year.</p>

It’s a way to supplement and expand the experience, not replace it.”</span></p>

<p>Optic-based technologies enable engineers to reassemble the past with such vividness, but as individuals and institutions increasingly embrace these methods to protect history and culture, we have to also think about the reliability of reproductions — what transformations occur when one progresses from an original artifact to an image to a software-created object. Artist and RISD professor <a href="http://clementvalla.com/" target="_blank">Clement Valla</a> introduces this discourse to <em>The Missing</em> through one of his draped foam sculptures based on an ancient vase in the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#8217;s collection. From a 3D model of a krater, he has created a foam copy that replicates the original artifact&#8217;s shape and size, then blanketed that copy with linen on which he printed a flattened image of the 3D model. The result dances between sculpture and image, illuminating the various processes that constitute a reproduction and that ultimately favor and focus on surface appearances. Valla approaches digital reconstruction — &#8220;reverse archaeology,&#8221; as he called it — with a critical eye, acknowledging that while such efforts do salvage works, they may, just as excavations often do, introduce an unintended, largely unavoidable destruction of a different kind.</p>
<p>At a <a href="http://johnjay.jjay.cuny.edu/acalendar/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&amp;eventidn=8715&amp;information_id=23804&amp;type=&amp;syndicate=syndicate" target="_blank">panel</a> held in conjunction with the exhibit last week, one woman in the audience preceded her question with a request that Allahyari change the projected slide, which happened to be looping the clip of ISIS members trashing the Mosul Museum.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to have nightmares about it,&#8221; she said, and urged for &#8220;something more uplifting.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we watch these terrorist-released videos, our immediate response may be to feel disheartened and helpless in the face of such blatant<strong> </strong>violence. But as <em>The Missing</em> demonstrates, there are ways to resist those bent on breeding fear. Even if we cannot always repair and regain fragments of our physical world, we can at least attempt to piece together history — and do so with proper intention and awareness.</p>

<h2>Recollections of the Stork</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the daffy, gawkiness of him<br />
is the engine that whirrs and allows flight?<br />
His song a <i>hyoshigi</i>, <i>den­-den daiko</i>,<br />
<i>kokiriko</i> call. His house <i>mikoshi</i><br />
borne aloft. And atop that house, a phoenix.</p>
<p>The sun’s motion across the sky affects nothing,<br />
the stork’s flight of constant length, the shadow<br />
it casts on canoes, the time a father lives<br />
or how long the water seems glassy,<br />
stork legs in deep water, ahead of the boat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>In Western Michigan</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why call a river Grand when it is so<br />
cold, skin roiling like a geyser, the birds<br />
speaking a kind of French only Germans<br />
understand? The drift is something like<br />
a kingdom floating on the foam of day,<br />
the hand of a friend seen so far ahead<br />
in time as to be time gone, time before.</p>
<p>Here I might sit for all of time, the days<br />
become hours, minutes becoming seconds,<br />
a backyard or a bar you could never stand,<br />
better than an enormous green sward<br />
with a single space to make it important<br />
(to me, at least) and a place that might hold<br />
the light of some ceaseless sun, forever.</p>

<p>Dressed in a crisp tuxedo, Swiss artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Seligmann" target="_blank">Kurt Seligmann</a> stepped into a chalk circle lined with the names of archangels on the wood floor of his Manhattan apartment. It was May 8, 1948, and with sculptor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Donati" target="_blank">Enrico Donati</a>, he led his assembled party guests in a ritual to summon the dead. The performance recreated a rite by <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/267999/reassembling-the-lost-library-of-a-16th-century-magician-who-spoke-to-angels/" target="_blank">16th-century magician John Dee</a> and his medium, Edward Kelly, that had been included in Seligmann&#8217;s new book <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_mirror_of_magic.html?id=EojNAAAAMAAJ" target="_blank">The Mirror of Magic</a>. </em>Seligmann was then a central figure to Surrealism in New York City, and the scene&#8217;s magic expert. The book compiled his extensive esoteric knowledge of the occult, magic, alchemy, and other topics, as well as his views on these subjects&#8217; historical influence on art.</p>

<p>In <em><a href="http://www.languageofthebirds.org/" target="_blank">Language of the Birds: Occult and Art</a>, </em>now on view at New York University&#8217;s 80WSE Gallery, that magic circle is again recreated, this time by contemporary esoteric artist <a href="http://jesse-bransford.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Jesse Bransford</a> alongside a photograph of the 1948 event. Two paintings by Seligmann join the new circle in a gallery space called &#8220;Altar.&#8221; Among its talismans are Donati&#8217;s 1946 sculpture of a fist with two glass eyes — one blue and one black to symbolize the evil eye — as well two new works by Rebecca Salmon: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_of_Glory" target="_blank">&#8220;Hand of Glory&#8221;</a> (a hand of a criminal made into a candle) and a larynx sculpture that hovers above. The exhibition is in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.phantasmaphile.com/occult-humanities/" target="_blank">Occult Humanities Conference</a> (February 5–7) at New York University and features over 60 modern and contemporary artists who have instilled their work with magic.</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole &#8216;Altar&#8217; room feels like a spirit chamber, and I find it a very moving place to be,&#8221; curator Pam Grossman, who&#8217;s also the creator of the blog <a href="http://www.phantasmaphile.com/" target="_blank">Phantasmaphile</a>, told Hyperallergic. &#8220;It is a space for contemplation. It gives historical context. It is an offering of thanks by Bransford, Salmon, and myself to those occult artists who came before us. It is a circle of balance and sacred alignment. There is so much going on in it, and in many ways, it is a big energy axis around which the entire <em>Language of the Birds</em> exhibition rotates.&#8221;</p>
<p>The show is an impressive assembly of some of the most influential artists to interpret the occult, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley" target="_blank">Aleister Crowley</a> with his trance portraiture and <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/64346/visionary-art-unstuck-in-time-to-diagram-the-metaphysics-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">Paul Laffoley</a> with his painted guides to metaphysics, as well as artists less often associated with magic, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_Smith" target="_blank">Kiki Smith</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Clemente" target="_blank">Francesco Clemente</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;The primary thesis statement, so-to-speak, of <em>Language of the Birds</em> is that art is a form of magic making,&#8221; Grossman explained. &#8220;We have several works in the show that are not only about magic, but which purport to be spells themselves. That said, it felt important to have a room in the show which felt like one grand magical working, so that&#8217;s how the &#8216;Altar&#8217; evolved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seligmann was born in Basel, Switzerland, in 1900, and arrived in New York <a href="http://www.sullivangoss.com/kurt_Seligmann/" target="_blank">in 1940</a> as one of the first Surrealists to flee the Nazis for the United States. He helped many other artists travel over the Atlantic, including some in the infamous <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art#The_Entartete_Kunst_exhibit">Entartete Kunst (Degenerate Art)</a> </em>exhibition of 1937, and encouraged the Surrealist movement to flourish in a new American home. He saw magic as connected to his art — not a deliberate part of each work, but rather a way of centralizing knowledge of the universe. As he wrote <a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/08/things-do-aug-29-sept-5" target="_blank">in 1946</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Magic philosophy teaches that the universe is one, that every phenomenon in the world of matter and of ideas obeys the one law which co-ordinates the All. Such doctrine sounds like a program for the painter: is it not his task to shape into a perfect unity within his canvas the variety of depicted forms?</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;In addition to being a tremendously sensitive painter and relatively undersung Surrealist, Seligmann was an aficionado of occult symbols and systems,&#8221; Grossman stated. He kept a huge library of occult books, and <em>Mirror of Magic</em> was among the first English publications on magic intended for a wide audience. &#8220;The Surrealists considered him their resident magic expert, and he had a big influence on the occult tropes and techniques which showed up throughout that movement,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>With their tornadic, abstract figures — influenced in part by carnivals remembered from his childhood — and dreamlike Surrealist imagery, Seligmann&#8217;s paintings remain powerful and strange, although not well known. Weinstein Gallery, which is loaning the works on view in<em> Language of the Birds</em>, hosted <a href="http://www.weinstein.com/artists/kurt-seligmann/" target="_blank">a retrospective</a> of his work last summer, and in 2014 he was a focus of the <em><a href="http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/surrealismandmagic/" target="_blank">Surrealism and Magic</a></em> exhibition at Cornell University&#8217;s Johnson Museum of Art. Yet he remains obscure, possibly due to his occult associations, as well as his falling out <a href="http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/surrealismandmagic/exhibition/introduction/inout.html" target="_blank">in 1943</a> with Surrealist founder André Breton; some say it was due to a public disagreement over tarot cards.</p>
<p>Seligmann and his wife, Arlette, later moved upstate to a farm in the hamlet of Sugarloaf in Orange County, New York. He died <a href="http://www.weinstein.com/artists/kurt-seligmann/" target="_blank">in 1962</a> in a freak gun accident (he was attempting to shoot rats attacking his bird feeder and slipped on the ice), and when Arlette passed away in 1992, she left his estate to the <a href="http://www.occitizensfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Orange County Citizens Foundation</a>. It now runs the <a href="http://www.occitizensfoundation.org/seligmann-center/" target="_blank">Seligmann Center</a> in his memory at his farm, and through it his legacy of esoteric knowledge and fantastical art continues. In <em>Language of the Birds</em>, his spirit is temporarily resurrected in New York City, like a phantom conjured through a magic circle.</p>

<p>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — It might seem like a leap, using gorgeous studio glass objects to convey potentially alarming data about population growth, but <a href="http://www.norwoodviviano.com/" target="_blank">Norwood Viviano</a> pulls the two together very persuasively. &#8220;Global Cities&#8221; (2015), his installation at the <a href="http://www.artmuseumgr.org/2015/08/26/michigan-artist-series-norwood-viviano-global-cities/" target="_blank">Grand Rapids Art Museum</a> (GRAM), translates graphs that register explosive growth in urban populations around the world — from New York, Rome, and Mexico City to Sydney, Lagos, and Shanghai — into the varying contours of glass pendants.</p>

<p>Viviano, who is based in a small town near Kalamazoo, applies 3D computer imaging to making objects that reflect his concerns about the impact of industry and population on ecosystems. His conceptual approach to glass, ceramic, steel, and other materials often associated with craft and design is reflected in the intriguing range of venues where he has exhibited. They include the <a href="http://www.norwoodviviano.com/news/lincoln-motor-company-commission/" target="_blank">Lincoln Motor Company</a>, Detroit; the <a href="http://www.cmog.org/bio/norwood-viviano" target="_blank">Corning Museum of Glass</a>; the Museum of Decorative Arts, Prague; and the Royal College of Art, London. Presently, he is preparing work for a group exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution’s Renwick Gallery.</p>
<p>Installed in a gallery that GRAM uses for <a href="http://www.artmuseumgr.org/art/michigan-artist-series/" target="_blank">showing contemporary regional work</a>, &#8220;Global Cities&#8221; pulls together three modes of representation. One is the expansive, horizontal map that’s delineated on a platform in the middle of the floor. Another is the array of glass pendants, each representing a city and suspended from a tubular grid that reinforces the installation’s overall sense of order. The third is a graph featuring a horizontal lineup of vinyl silhouettes, displayed on one of the gallery walls.</p>
<div id="attachment_271079" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-271079" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Norwood-Viviano-grand-rapids-04.jpg" alt="Installation view of 'Norwood Viviano: Global Cities' at the Grand Rapids Art Museum" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Norwood-Viviano-grand-rapids-04-240x180.jpg 240w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Norwood-Viviano-grand-rapids-04-768x576.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Norwood-Viviano-grand-rapids-04-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Norwood-Viviano-grand-rapids-04.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Installation view of &#8216;Norwood Viviano: Global Cities&#8217; at the Grand Rapids Art Museum</p></div>
<p>In contour and color, the vinyl profiles correspond to the glass forms: the oldest cities are rendered in black, the next oldest are purple, and the newest are blue. But where the glass pendants are deployed according to their coordinates on the map on the floor, the vinyl silhouettes are read from left to right according to age, which is indicated by a vertical timeline. Thus, the oldest urban center is identified as Rome and has the tallest silhouette, while the youngest, and shortest, belongs to Shenzen, China.</p>
<div id="attachment_271078" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-271078" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Norwood-Viviano-grand-rapids-03.jpg" alt="Detail of Norwood Viviano, &quot;Global Cities&quot; (2015)" width="320" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Norwood-Viviano-grand-rapids-03-135x180.jpg 135w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Norwood-Viviano-grand-rapids-03-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Norwood-Viviano-grand-rapids-03.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Detail of Norwood Viviano, &#8220;Global Cities&#8221; (2015)</p></div>
<p>Viviano measured the age of each city based on the point at which each was given the name under which it’s generally, presently known. This means that their deeper histories, based on settlement by First Peoples, isn’t necessarily reflected. It’s only when these places are given enduring names — names that effectively abstract them, just as political maps abstract physical terrain — that their existence is recognized. Not coincidentally, this often is the point at which these places were colonized by Europeans. This imposition of abstract order seems to be one of Viviano’s themes, and a way in which he demonstrates a tension between (but also a unity of) concept and material.</p>
<p>As noted above, cities&#8217; relative ages are put in historical context by the vertical timeline, which indicates various historic events as well as dates, allowing visitors to cross-reference events like the fall of Rome and World War II with population graphs. Thus, the fall of Rome corresponds with a period of severe and protracted population loss in that city. The Second World War relates to population declines in such cities as London and Tokyo. At such points, the vinyl silhouettes and the glass forms narrow significantly. However, during periods of relative peace and prosperity, the graphs bulge out to indicate growth.</p>
<div id="attachment_271081" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Norwood-Viviano-grand-rapids-06.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-271081"><img class="wp-image-271081" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Norwood-Viviano-grand-rapids-06.jpg" alt="Detail of Norwood Viviano, &quot;Global Cities&quot; (2015)" width="320" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Norwood-Viviano-grand-rapids-06-135x180.jpg 135w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Norwood-Viviano-grand-rapids-06-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Norwood-Viviano-grand-rapids-06.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Detail of Norwood Viviano, &#8220;Global Cities&#8221; (2015) (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>Beijing provides a dramatic example of alternating periods of moderate growth and dramatic decline, all capped with exponential expansion, creating a shape akin to an immense floral bloom atop a narrow stalk. In contrast to Beijing and other cities in booming, former Third World economies, the silhouettes of Western cities are relatively static or show steady growth. Tiny Grand Rapids is an example of the former and New York exemplifies the latter. Grand Rapids is represented by a piece about the size and shape of a stopper for a small perfume bottle. As for NYC, its silhouette registers continued growth since the mid-19th century, such that it resembles the profile of a martini glass.</p>
<p>But reading numbers is one thing. What makes Viviano’s installation into a viewing experience is the fine craftwork of the glass pendants, which also resemble the plumb bobs used in construction work. Viviano uses a glass-making method called <em><a href="http://www.cmog.org/video/reticello" target="_blank">reticello</a></em>, in which clusters of glass canes are laid crosswise and fused, then sculpted to create forms that are embedded with fluid, diagonal grids or lattices. Here, the lattices expand and contract in relation to the fluctuations of population as expressed in the objects’ contours. The effect of these lines, which also evoke measurements of longitude and latitude, is mesmerizing, especially as each pendant ineluctably expands.</p>
<p>Standing near this gleaming array gave me shivers. I felt I was witnessing a gorgeously embodied, unfolding disaster. Not a pleasant feeling, needless to say, but it left me hoping that viewers in denial about the effects of endless growth might be seduced into realizing how fragile these urban civilizations are, and how close they are to shattering.</p>

Crimes are rated on a highly subjective scale from one “Scream” emoji — the equivalent of a vandal tagging the exterior of a local history museum in a remote part of the US — to five “Scream” emojis — the equivalent of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum heist.</em></p>
<h2>King Tut&#8217;s Barbers Charged</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-185110 alignleft" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/crimes-of-the-art-scream-4.jpg" alt="crimes-of-the-art-scream-4" width="200" height="50" />Eight employees of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo are due to be <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/24/africa/king-tut-broken-mask-charges/index.html" target="_blank">charged with negligence</a> for a haphazard restoration of King Tutankhamun&#8217;s burial mask. The beard of the 3,300-year-old mask fell off under mysterious circumstances and was <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/176892/king-tut-burial-mask-broken-glued-back-together/" target="_blank">clumsily reattached</a>, potentially causing further damage to the prized artifact.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> The Egyptian legal system makes the curse of the mummy look like a cakewalk.</p>
<h2>Art Trailer&#8217;s Trail Goes Cold</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-185109 alignleft" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/crimes-of-the-art-scream-3.jpg" alt="crimes-of-the-art-scream-3" width="150" height="50" />A trailer containing artworks by Henri Matisse, Marc Chagall, Joan Miró, Keith Haring, and other goods cumulatively worth some $250,000 was <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-trailer-stolen-matisse-20160119-story.html" target="_blank">stolen</a> from an industrial park in the Chatsworth area of Los Angeles. The theft happened in November of last year, but the LAPD&#8217;s art theft squad still has no leads.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Those must be some <em>pretty weak</em> works by Haring, Matisse, Chagall, Miró, and company if they barely add up to $250,000 in value.</p>
<h2>Chi Museum Not Shy about Suing</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-185108 alignleft" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/crimes-of-the-art-scream-2.jpg" alt="crimes-of-the-art-scream-2" width="100" height="50" />The Art Institute of Chicago <a href="http://cookcountyrecord.com/stories/510658845-chicago-art-institute-accuses-level-3-construction-of-damaging-underground-vault" target="_blank">filed a lawsuit</a> against four engineering and construction companies, claiming that one of the museum&#8217;s underground vaults had to be replaced after the companies damaged its roof while creating a concrete trench for telecommunications cables.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> There&#8217;s a silver lining to this story — we now know the Art Institute has secret underground vaults.</p>
<h2>Hockey-Playing Beaver Statue Disappears</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-185107 alignleft" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/crimes-of-the-art-scream-1.jpg" alt="crimes-of-the-art-scream-1" width="50" height="50" />A beloved steel sculpture of a beaver holding a hockey stick, long a fixture in the front yard of Edmonton residents David and Susan Holdsworth, <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/news/someone-has-stolen-a-hockey-stick-holding-metal-beaver-from-outside-an-edmonton-home" target="_blank">disappeared overnight</a>. The sculpture, made by local artist Joe Renaud from scrap metal, was welded to a bench and supported by a pile that went several feet into the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> That&#8217;s a dam shame.</p>
<h2>Gandhi Gets Pro-ISIS Makeover</h2>
<div id="attachment_270989" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-270989" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/crimes-art-gandhi-isis.jpg" alt="The vandalized Gandhi statue in Dudu (screenshot via @ANI_news/Twitter)" width="640" height="565" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/crimes-art-gandhi-isis-204x180.jpg 204w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/crimes-art-gandhi-isis.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The vandalized Gandhi statue in Dudu (screenshot via <a href="https://twitter.com/ANI_news/status/691551524766375936" target="_blank">@ANI_news/Twitter</a>)</p></div>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> If there&#8217;s any group against which Gandhi&#8217;s brand of non-violent protest wouldn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s ISIS.</p>
<h2>All Roads Lead to Trashed Roman Ruins</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-185110 alignleft" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/crimes-of-the-art-scream-4.jpg" alt="crimes-of-the-art-scream-4" width="200" height="50" />Roman tombs along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appian_Way" target="_blank">Appian Way</a> that date to the 2nd century BCE have been used for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/26/illegal-dumping-in-roman-catacombs-leaves-precious-ancient-site-polluted" target="_blank">illegal trash disposal</a>. Italian police investigating environmental pollution claims discovered them flooded by an underground lake of oil.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Sounds like a golden opportunity for one of Italy&#8217;s controversial <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/138050/patrimony-acrimony-italy-turns-to-private-funding-for-restoration/" target="_blank">sponsored restoration projects</a> — make way for the &#8220;Mr. Clean Appian Way Tombs&#8221;!</p>
<h2>World&#8217;s Slowest Art Thief Steals Sculpture of World&#8217;s Fastest Animal</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-185107 alignleft" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/crimes-of-the-art-scream-1.jpg" alt="crimes-of-the-art-scream-1" width="50" height="50" />A man <a href="http://www.ksbw.com/news/carmel-art-theft-caught-on-surveillance-video/37638858" target="_blank">stole</a> a $24,000 sculpture of a cheetah bust by Richard MacDonald from the <a href="http://www.dawsoncolefineart.com/" target="_blank">Dawson Cole Fine Art Gallery</a> in Carmel, California. The entire theft was caught on camera, as was the man&#8217;s reconnaissance visit the night before, when he initially took the sculpture and then put it back in its place.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Returning to the scene of the crime is dumb enough, but repeating the crime on successive nights is much, much dumber.</p>
<h2>Thieves <em>Really</em> Love Heart Sculpture</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-185107 alignleft" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/crimes-of-the-art-scream-1.jpg" alt="crimes-of-the-art-scream-1" width="50" height="50" />Two men spent an hour outside Las Vegas&#8217;s Container Park unbolting &#8220;The Love Locket,&#8221; a public artwork in the shape of a heart and covered in locks, and then <a href="http://news3lv.com/news/local/caught-on-camera-thieves-vandalize-artwork-at-container-park" target="_blank">made off</a> with half of the sculpture. Though many witnesses saw them unfastening the work, nobody stopped them.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> You&#8217;d think all those locks would have made the thing harder to steal.</p>

<p>It has been said that when gods fall, the earth shakes.</p>
<p>Yesterday night, the news broke that the Alabama-based African-American artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thornton_Dial" target="_blank">Thornton Dial</a> had died on Monday at his home in McCalla, just southeast of Birmingham, at the age of 87. A master of what label-loving art historians and merchants might refer to as post-Cubist assemblage or postmodern appropriation, not to mention of his own variety of unaffected expressionism and a fluid style of draftsmanship that was both lyrical and semi-abstract, Dial was an artist whose ideas and creations fit into all and none of those establishment-dictated categories at the same time. As with the most innovative, most remarkable self-taught artists of any time or place, both his worldview and the evidence of his artistic achievement were and remain unique and, ultimately, unclassifiable.</p>
<p>In an international art world whose mainstream institutions and market celebrate cynicism and superficiality, and are fueled by ego and hype, the bell tolls for Dial today more softly than it should. (Always quick to trumpet the new, banal, high-priced baubles of Jeff Koons or Damien Hirst, the <em>New York Times</em> offered no obituary this morning — for major cultural figures, such pieces are normally prepared well in advance — although the Associated Press weighed in <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4045e472f56041b2a91d1b7150acf675/self-taught-painter-sculptor-thornton-dial-dies" target="_blank">with a brief report</a>.) However, for those familiar with the accomplishments of this visionary American artist of the 20th and early 21st century period, the tremor they’re feeling upon the news of Dial’s death is one that rocks canonical modern-art history to its very foundation.</p>
<div id="attachment_271010" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dont-Matter.jpg"><img class="wp-image-271010" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dont-Matter.jpg" alt="Thornton Dial, “Don’t Matter How Raggly The Flag, It Still Got To Tie Us Together” (2003), mattress coils, chicken wire, clothing, can lids, found metal, plastic twine, wire, Splash Zone compound, enamel, and spray paint on canvas on wood, 71 x 114 x 8 inches, collection of Indianapolis Museum of Art (photo by Stephen Pitkin/Pitkin Studio, courtesy Souls Grown Deep Foundation) (click to enlarge)" width="640" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dont-Matter-270x180.jpg 270w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dont-Matter-768x512.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dont-Matter-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dont-Matter.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Thornton Dial, “Don’t Matter How Raggly The Flag, It Still Got To Tie Us Together” (2003), mattress coils, chicken wire, clothing, can lids, found metal, plastic twine, wire, Splash Zone compound, enamel, and spray paint on canvas on wood, 71 x 114 x 8 inches, collection of Indianapolis Museum of Art (photo by Stephen Pitkin/Pitkin Studio, courtesy Souls Grown Deep Foundation) (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>Dial was an art-maker who, like Pablo Picasso, Alberto Giacometti, Louise Bourgeois, and Anselm Kiefer, dared to take on themes that were as big as his technical skills were refined. In his art he examined slavery, racism, the struggle of the oppressed for their rights and freedom, war, the abuse of women, nature’s inexplicable forces — and hope and beauty, too. Its maker experienced many hardships and challenges in his lifetime, from poverty to the ugly, institutionalized racism of his native region, but instead of taking a bitter, cynical turn, Dial’s art was shaped in large part by his abiding faith in the redemptive power of aspiration — of keeping hope alive — and of looking for the unsinkable good in even the darkest episodes of history or the most discouraging expressions of the human spirit.</p>
<p>That might have been because Dial, like many of the most singular autodidacts, made his work primarily for himself, not for any market or public. Dial instinctively aimed for something alien to and bigger than any concern of the established market: truth. Just a few years ago, in early 2011, on the occasion of an exhibition of his work <a href="http://www.imamuseum.org/art/exhibitions/dial" target="_blank">opening at the Indianapolis Museum of Art</a>, Dial observed:</p>
<blockquote><p>All truth is hard truth. We’re in the darkness now and we got to accept the hard truth to bring on the light. You can hide the truth but you can’t get rid of it. When truth come out in the light, we get the beauty of the world.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_271011" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lost-Cows.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-271011"><img class="wp-image-271011" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lost-Cows.jpg" alt="Thornton Dial, “Lost Cows” (2000-2001), cow skeletons, steel, golf bag, golf ball, mirrors, enamel, and Splash Zone compound, 76.5 x 91 x 52 inches (photo by Stephen Pitkin/Pitkin Studio, courtesy Souls Grown Deep Foundation) (click to enlarge)" width="320" height="378" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lost-Cows-768x906.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lost-Cows-868x1024.jpg 868w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lost-Cows.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Thornton Dial, “Lost Cows” (2000-2001), cow skeletons, steel, golf bag, golf ball, mirrors, enamel, and Splash Zone compound, 76.5 x 91 x 52 inches (photo by Stephen Pitkin/Pitkin Studio, courtesy Souls Grown Deep Foundation) (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>Not to press the point too finely (although because in today’s world so much art product is made not by artists themselves but rather by contracted fabricators, it really cannot be emphasized enough), but Dial was one of those artists who actually <em>made things</em> — that is, with his own two hands. It is impossible to fully appreciate his art without grasping that essential aspect of all of his oeuvre. Then again, Dial’s work proclaims its creator’s technical proficiency, and his sheer delight in the handling of his materials and his discovery of their expressive power, in every twist of a metal rod or splash of paint on a scrap of fabric or thrust of a color-saturated line that gives shape to his mixed-media constructions or pictures on paper.</p>
<p>There was no room in Dial’s aesthetic vision for the rejection — so celebrated by certain theory-driven, too-cool-for-school (or just too schooled?), “professional” modern and contemporary artists — of the visible touch of the art-maker’s hand in their creations. Dial’s art was unabashedly hands-on and heart-full from the start — and deeply rooted in personal experience.</p>
<p>Dial was born in 1928, in west-central Alabama, to a family of sharecroppers who had long eked out a meager living picking cotton. His unwed teenage mother gave her child to relatives to bring up when he was still an infant, and by the age of six, Thornton found himself working in the fields. He was in the third grade when his formal education came to an end. In interviews with the Atlanta-based art historian and collector <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/177156/from-the-deep-south-an-overlooked-chapter-in-art-history/" target="_blank">William S. Arnett</a>, a longtime champion of Dial’s work who founded the <a href="http://soulsgrowndeep.org/" target="_blank">Souls Grown Deep Foundation</a> in 2010, the artist recalled:</p>
<blockquote><p>A midwife delivered me to my mama in a little country house in the field, one of them kind you can lay down and look up through the ceiling and see the sunshine. … We picked cotton when we got big enough to walk. … I was just a little bitty something but I had to earn my way.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 1941, Dial, who was still a teenager, moved with his half-brother to Bessemer, an industrial city near Birmingham, where, he told Arnett, he was instructed, “Learn to figure out your money and write your name: That’s as far as a Negro can go.”</p>
<p>In Bessemer, Dial did odd jobs — highway construction, brick loading, pipe fitting, house painting — and became an employee of a Pullman railway-carriage factory, where he worked for many years and learned to weld. At home, he used found metal and wood scraps, and other materials to make decorative objects — in effect, the prototypes of what would evolve into his later artworks. Those early concoctions, like all of his art, were steeped in the tradition of African-American “yard art,” which itself was rooted in the African spiritual practice of crafting talismanic objects to protect the home or body. Such piles or agglomerations of rusty machine parts, wire, wood, empty cans, and other repurposed materials are directly linked, formally and thematically, to Dial’s art.</p>
<div id="attachment_271009" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Beginning-of-Life.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-271009"><img class="wp-image-271009" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Beginning-of-Life.jpg" alt="Thornton Dial, “Beginning of Life in the Yellow Jungle” (2003), plastic soda bottles, doll, clothing, bedding, wire, found metal, rubber glove, turtle shell, artificial flowers, Splash Zone compound, enamel, and spray paint on canvas on wood, 75 x 112 x 13 inches, collection of Nancy and Tim Grumbacher (photo by Stephen Pitkin/Pitkin Studio, courtesy Souls Grown Deep Foundation) (click to enlarge)" width="640" height="437" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Beginning-of-Life-264x180.jpg 264w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Beginning-of-Life-768x524.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Beginning-of-Life-1024x699.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Beginning-of-Life.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Thornton Dial, “Beginning of Life in the Yellow Jungle” (2003), plastic soda bottles, doll, clothing, bedding, wire, found metal, rubber glove, turtle shell, artificial flowers, Splash Zone compound, enamel, and spray paint on canvas on wood, 75 x 112 x 13 inches, collection of Nancy and Tim Grumbacher (photo by Stephen Pitkin/Pitkin Studio, courtesy Souls Grown Deep Foundation) (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>By contrast, as a young man, fresh out of college, Arnett traveled to Europe and briefly lived in England. After taking in the architecture of many European cities and the treasures of their famous museums’ collections — he savored everything from ancient antiquities to modernist masterpieces — Arnett returned to the US, eventually opened a gallery, and then eased into his own independent work as an art researcher. In time, his encounters with the artistic creations of self-taught black artists of the Deep South changed his understanding of what art could be — and express.</p>
<p>Last year, recalling his discovery of the works of such artists in the region as Dial, Lonnie Holley, Joe Minter, Ronald Lockett, Charlie Lucas, Mose Tolliver, Jimmy Lee Sudduth, Emmer Sewell, and the quilt makers of the hamlet of Gee’s Bend, Alabama, among many others, Arnett told me, “It was there, in plain sight.” He was referring to “yard art” in particular and to the aesthetic that informed it and all of these artists’ creations in general.</p>

<p>In 1987, Holley introduced Arnett to Dial (who was then 56 years old). Arnett became Dial’s main patron, collected his work in depth, and enthusiastically promoted his talent and vision. But the art establishment was reluctant to make room for an uneducated, black, self-taught artist from rural Alabama in its canon of 20th-century masters and resisted rewarding Dial’s work with the critical attention it deserved. (There is much more to this part of the story, but it is, alas, another complex one, involving various kinds of self-interest, media misrepresentation, and art-market machinations.)</p>
<p>Remembering when he first met Dial, Arnett has remarked, “I knew I was witnessing something great coming out of that turkey coop. … I can’t think of any important artist who has started with less or accomplished more.”</p>
<p>Despite the obstacles, in time Dial’s work did break through, and over the years noteworthy, well-documented exhibitions of his art have been presented at museums and commercial galleries in New York, Houston, Atlanta, Indianapolis, and many other cities. Just a few months ago, Manhattan’s <a href="http://www.artnews.com/2015/10/20/marianne-boesky-announces-representation-of-thornton-dial/" target="_blank">Marianne Boesky Gallery announced</a> that it had taken over representation of Dial’s oeuvre; its first exhibition, of a <a href="http://www.marianneboeskygallery.com/exhibitions/thornton-dial-works-on-paper/pressRelease" target="_blank">selection of the artist’s works on paper</a>, ran through mid-December. Most notably, just over a year ago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced that <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/164651/the-met-museum-nets-major-collection-of-outsider-art-from-the-south/" target="_blank">nearly 60 works of art</a> from the William S. Arnett Collection of the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, including 10 of Dial’s, had been donated to the institution, whose curators had played a direct role in choosing them. A selection of works from this donation is scheduled to go on view at the museum later this year.</p>

<p>There is almost nothing Dial did not use to make his freestanding or wall-mounted constructions, including scraps of old clothes, mattress coils, metal-can lids, plastic twine, wire, epoxy patching compound, enamel, and spray paint.</p>
<p>Several months before the autumn 2005 opening of <em>Thornton Dial in the 21st Century</em> at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, accompanied by Arnett, I visited Dial at his home near Bessemer, to speak with him about his life and art-making, and about the themes of the works he was planning to present in that large exhibition. It was a stressful time for “Mr. Dial,” as everyone referred to the artist, with admiration and respect, for his wife Clara Mae’s health was in decline, and he had just returned home after visiting her in a nearby hospital. (She died in 2005.) After showing me his workspaces — a garage-like structure packed with works in progress, tools, and assorted materials; a patch of hard ground that stretched out in front of it; and even some scraggly bushes adorned with hand-painted odds and ends — the artist led me into his kitchen, where Arnett and two of Dial’s adult children were seated, chatting.</p>
<p>“I want to show you something I just did,” the artist said, handing me a stack of used file folders he had slit in half with his pocketknife to create small, single sheets. “I made these while I was waiting to see Clara Mae. I ran out of paper, so I asked the nurse for something, and this is what she gave me.” (Dial spoke in a thick, rich, local Alabama dialect, which I cannot easily transcribe.)</p>
<p>I looked through the pile of pencil drawings on light-blue and light-green file-folder paper with interest. In them swirled the faces of Dial’s familiar women, the forms of birds, and his proud, emblematic tiger, which in his art serves as a kind of alter ego, as well as a reference to the spirit of the jungle and the combination of perseverance and cunning that African-Americans have long instinctively employed in their struggle to survive in a hostile society. Also among the drawings were several depicting big wiry blobs, complete abstractions that exuded an energy at once ferocious and calm. I asked him: “What do these pictures represent, Mr. Dial? Moses’ burning bush?”</p>
<p>“Could be,” he replied as he examined his handiwork. “Could be. Or maybe they’re just life. They just life.”</p>
<p>If Dial’s work endures — and it will, and in death it is quite likely that appreciation of his achievements will exceed what the artist ever witnessed while he was alive — it will do so not only for the inventiveness and raw creative energy it expresses in every piece. And not just because, as an unfettered expression of one attentive, empathetic black American’s experience, it dares to bear witness and to reach. It will resonate and last because, with not-so-quiet defiance, in an age of exasperation and cynicism, Dial’s art emphatically reaffirms life.</p>
<p>For some people, that’s something that might really shake them up.</p>

<p>Yesterday, as part of his tour of Europe, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani visited Rome&#8217;s <a href="http://en.museicapitolini.org/" target="_blank">Capitoline Museums</a>, where he met Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi. A member of his staff <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BA-pnaJw9ww/" target="_blank">uploaded</a> an impressive photograph of the museum&#8217;s iconic equestrian statue to his Instagram, but Rouhani never managed to see a number of the institution&#8217;s most ’grammed and treasured marble sculptures, which museum officials covered up in anticipation of his visit, for fear that their nudeness might offend him.</p>
<div id="attachment_270956" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/venus.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-270956"><img class="wp-image-270956" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/venus.jpg" alt="The Capitoline Venus (image via Wikipedia) (click to enlarge)" width="320" height="722" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/venus-768x1733.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/venus-454x1024.jpg 454w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/venus.jpg 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Capitoline Venus (image <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitoline_Venus#/media/File:Capitoline_Venus_Musei_Capitolini_MC0409.jpg" target="_blank">via Wikipedia</a>) (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>As Italian news site Corriere <a href="http://video.corriere.it/roma-niente-nudi-rouhani-coperte-statue-musei-capitolini/d8a7f106-c3a5-11e5-b326-365a9a1e3b10" target="_blank">reported</a>, a number of statues — including the museum&#8217;s famed Capitoline Venus — were kept hidden under <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/171451/9-minimalist-boxes-for-boxing-day/" target="_blank">minimalist white boxes</a>, inadvertently transforming the museum&#8217;s hallowed hallways into an unauthorized Donald Judd installation. It also closed a gallery housing Pietro da Cortona&#8217;s 1627 painting &#8220;<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cortona_Rape_of_the_Sabine_Women_01.jpg" target="_blank">The Rape of the Sabine Women</a>&#8221; and the <a href="http://en.museicapitolini.org/collezioni/percorsi_per_sale/museo_del_palazzo_dei_conservatori/sale_degli_horti_lamiani" target="_blank">Halls of the Horti Lamiani</a>, filled with impeccably chiseled, but alas, wholly exposed nipples belonging to the likes of the Esquiline Venus and a couple of sea centaurs. The censorship is apparently part of a &#8220;blackout&#8221; of nudes arranged by the museum in agreement with Renzi&#8217;s office as a sign of respect for Iranian culture. According to Corriere, a toast during a dinner held in honor of Rouhani was also void of alcohol.</p>
<p>Italians were quick to object to the cover-ups, describing the action as a renouncement of their culture. Many took to Twitter, flooding the social network with images of nude sculptures accompanied by the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/statuenude?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">#statuenude</a>. Local politicians also chimed in; MP Daniele Capezzone, for instance, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/12122665/Anger-in-Italy-after-authorities-cover-up-nude-Roman-statues-of-goddesses-so-as-not-to-offend-Iranian-president.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank">said</a> the censorship introduced &#8220;a touch of the ridiculous&#8221; to Rouhani&#8217;s visit.</p>
<p>“Italy bowing down to the Iranians like this is embarrassing,&#8221; Capezzone said. “Is Italy reduced to this? And to not serve wine, again so as not to ‘offend’?”</p>
<p>Gianluca Peciola, another local politician, was so outraged that he launched an <a href="https://www.change.org/p/il-premier-renzi-spieghi-la-vergogna-delle-statue-coperte-per-rouhani-matteorenzi-statuenude" target="_blank">online petition</a> calling on Renzi to immediately explain what he considers a disgrace and humiliation in the name of art and culture, writing that national principles had been severely violated and compromised. As of press time, it has received nearly 800 signatures.</p>
<p>Rouhani plans to fly to Paris following his tour of Italy. Unless the French government has plans to follow the Italians&#8217; lead, the president would do well to avoid the Louvre and the <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/212874/the-queens-vagina-sparks-controversy-at-versailles/" target="_blank">gardens of Versailles</a>.</p>

<p>HOBART, Tasmania — She glared and said, “You don’t have a photo pass so get back behind the cones.”</p>
<p>I complied.</p>
<p>I moved behind one of several orange cones dotting a narrow strip of green space. An audience of tourists, children, and <a href="http://www.mofo.net.au/about/" target="_blank">MONA FOMA</a> festival-goers had gathered on either side of Salamanca Park Green in Hobart. Faux marshals, dressed in black with flourescent vests and reflective sunglasses, stood rigid and kept the public out of the center of the green. As if to diffuse their authority, they also handed out questionnaires and occasionally escorted someone across the green</p>
<div id="attachment_270894" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CatherineRyan.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-270894"><img class="wp-image-270894" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CatherineRyan.jpg" alt="Artist Catherine Ryan addressing the crowd (click to enlarge)" width="320" height="320" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CatherineRyan-180x180.jpg 180w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CatherineRyan-768x768.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CatherineRyan-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CatherineRyan.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Artist Catherine Ryan addressing the crowd (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>In the middle stood artist Catherine Ryan, who addressed the crowd with her bullhorn (in Australia a “large hailer”). Over the course of 15 minutes, she ran through several announcements: “Welcome to the parade to celebrate the end of public space and the beginning of public order”; “Our marshals will direct you the safest place behind the cones”; “We appreciate your cooperation. Please remain in the designated audience zone”; “The most vulnerable (to the water canon) part of your body is the eye — the retina can detach.” And finally: “For your safety and the safety of others it is imperative you stay behind the cones for the duration of the parade.” Her delivery was serious yet farcical, each pronouncement made “in our best interest,” much like a flight attendant’s directives during a safety demonstration.</p>
<p>Bagpipes sounded from the far end of the green to signal the procession. Security guards wearing black hats and reflective sunglasses surrounded a mobile sculpture covered in black plastic, wrapped tightly like a sushi roll. Canines accompanied them. The procession circled the green and made its way to the center, where the security guards placed larger orange cones. In front of them they positioned lifesize black silhouettes of people: a protester holding a sign, a few figures with arms up in defiance, a pregnant woman, and, at the far end of the green, what looked like a family — anyone who might be in a public space at any given time.</p>

<p>With a bucket and a large squirt gun, a security guard practiced his aim on the cutout figures. One by one he used each for target practice, gaining a few laughs from the crowd. Then the guards unveiled the sculpture: a water cannon, its black wrap shed onto the grass. Underneath its skin were rows of orange cones protruding like nipples. With tightly controlled movements the guards began pushing the cannon, traversing the green and shouting a direction in unison as they made hard pivots. On the top an invisible operator controlled a large gun made of PVC sewer piping, which sprayed the silhouettes and the crowd. One guard led the cannon, screaming at the crowd, “Move, move, move!” As he came towards me, I backed away to avoid him and the spray, even though the pressure wasn’t strong. I could see the logo on his patch. In Latin it read: “Publicum imperium, sine spatio” (public control, no space). After about 10 minutes, the water cannon left the green, running over the silhouette family on the way. With its departure the sprinklers came on, and many of the children along the sidelines ran into the space and started playing in the water.</p>

<p><a href="https://thefuturesofthepast.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Catherine Ryan and Amy Spiers</a>’s “No More Public Space, Only Public Order (Water Cannon)” was highly organized and beautifully choreographed, a hybrid performance-interventionist exercise in ordering the public and drawing attention to that control. Public order is nothing new, but as more activists take to the streets worldwide to protest injustice, the keeping of it has become increasingly violent and rationalized through mechanisms of fear. Ryan and Spiers infused their piece with a strong enough sense of anticipation — from the announcements to the procession, the unveiling to the exit — that they avoided turning it into a meaningless spectacle.<b> </b>The questionnaire, cannon sculpture, canines, and bagpipes all added up to a careful choreography of power, offering a commentary on how the state controls the public and the spaces it inhabits in the name of collective safety and common good.</p>
<div id="attachment_270906" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Move.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-270906"><img class="wp-image-270906" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Move.jpg" alt="A guard yells, &quot;Move!&quot;" width="320" height="320" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Move-180x180.jpg 180w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Move-768x768.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Move-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Move.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A guard yells, &#8220;Move!&#8221;</p></div>
<p>Yet a potent element of absurdity infused each layer of the work. The black hats and sunglasses were cheesy, but professional enough to be taken seriously. The cannon sprayed water, but not too hard, and the cones deflected any real imposition; it was clearly the safest water cannon in the world. Written by the philosopher and activist Nina Power, the “Public/Private” questionnaire asked about our collective, outer, inner, and anonymous selves. The visual, textual, and performative elements of the piece were droll enough to indicate that it was a work of art, but still offered enough provocation to leave you walking away unsettled by what could happen. With gentle satire, the piece evoked a reality experienced by protesters and activists in places like Turkey and Chile, but which many of us only see through the media.</p>
<p>As I watched the performance unfold, I heard a variety of responses. “What is this?,” asked one bystander. “It was scary but a little bit fun,” commented another. “Aren’t we lucky that we live in a country where we can take the piss out of this?” I remember hearing about a similar comment that George W. Bush had made, regarding the Iraq antiwar demonstrations: “Isn’t it great that we live in a democracy where people can disagree?” The mechanisms of control have gone down a dark road since then, if Ferguson is any indicator. My initial compliance to the marshal’s command to move behind the line was an automated response. I have been in enough controlled public spaces in the US — protests, festivals, sporting events, Critical Mass — to have a good idea of how to “behave” there. But that’s American public order, often oppressive, controlled with the spectre of fear, and rationalized that it’s for our safety. The relationship with authority is different, less oppressive in Australia. I met an older man who had immigrated from a country with harsh laws of order, and he felt physically confronted by the guards and the cannon; it brought back memories for him.</p>
<p>Most Australians would probably agree that it’s not so repressive here, that public space is not very threatened, and so it’s no surprise that children recolonized the green space with play so easily afterwards. Yet public spaces and the freedom they represent are still in danger of vanishing — even in the local context of Tasmania, where the government recently passed the Workplaces (Protections from Protesters) Act 2014, which is designed to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jan/20/logging-protesters-first-to-be-charged-under-tasmanias-anti-protest-laws" target="_blank">dissuade and penalize mining and logging activists</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-270913" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Water-cannon-move2.jpg" alt="Water-cannon-move2" width="640" height="565" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Water-cannon-move2-204x180.jpg 204w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Water-cannon-move2-768x677.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Water-cannon-move2-1024x903.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Water-cannon-move2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Our cultural backgrounds help inform our perceptions of public space, but as that space becomes increasingly privatized and controlled across the world, even the most trusting citizens in the most benevolent-seeming countries might have to face the effects of what happens when everyone is seen as a potential threat. The aftertaste of absurdity can be bit bitter.</p>

<p>LOS ANGELES — This week, in addition to the <a href="https://artlosangelesfair.com">Art Los Angeles Contemporary Art Fair</a> in Santa Monica, there are two independent art fairs happening, Dave Muller&#8217;s peripatetic Three Day Weekend project, the chance to interact with Erwin Wurm&#8217;s <em>One Minute Sculptures</em>, and more.</p>
<h2><img src="http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hyperbullet.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> Erwin Wurm: <em>One Minute Sculptures</em></h2>
<p>When: Opens Wednesday, January 27, 7–9pm<br />
Where: Schindler House (835 N Kings Road, West Hollywood, California)</p>
<p>Austrian artist Erwin Wurm&#8217;s <em><a href="http://makcenter.org/programming/erwin-wurm-one-minute-sculptures/" target="_blank">One Minute Sculptures</a></em> blur the lines between sculpture, conceptual art, and performance as they require the viewer&#8217;s participation in completing simple and comedic, yet revealing actions. Despite his wide-ranging influence, he has never been featured at a major institution in LA, so his upcoming show at the Schindler House is a great opportunity for Angelenos to get to see — and touch — his work. Viewers are invited to perform sets of instructions with various objects for 60 seconds at a time, thereby becoming collaborators in activating Wurm&#8217;s fanciful, open-ended artworks.</p>

<h2><img src="http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hyperbullet.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> Three Day Weekend: <em>Three Day Weekend</em></h2>
<p>When: Thursday, January 28 — Sunday, January 31<br />
Where: various locations</p>
<p>Organized by artist Dave Muller, Three Day Weekend is a nomadic project space that usually exists over the course of a long weekend. His upcoming <em><a href="http://www.blumandpoe.com/exhibitions/three-day-weekend-three-way-weekend#press1" target="_blank">Three Way Weekend</a> </em>is perhaps his most ambitious project, existing at three venues with 10 permutations. Three galleries — <a href="http://www.blumandpoe.com/" target="_blank">Blum &amp; Poe</a>, <a href="http://www.gricebench.com/" target="_blank">Grice Bench</a>, and ROGERS — have created their own exhibitions, featuring work by Roger White, Brian Sharp, Jon Pylypchuck, and Muller, which will rotate between Blum &amp; Poe, ROGERS, and booth A7 at this weekend&#8217;s <a href="https://artlosangelesfair.com/" target="_blank">Art Los Angeles Contemporary</a> fair. On Thursday, all three shows will be at ALAC, and on subsequent days they&#8217;ll switch between venues. If this all seems a bit confusing, Muller has come up with his own handy chart, or check <a href="http://www.blumandpoe.com/exhibitions/three-day-weekend-three-way-weekend#press1" target="_blank">here</a> for the complete schedule.</p>

<p>When: Friday, January 29 — Sunday, January 31<br />
Where: Highland Gardens Hotel (7047 Franklin Ave, Hollywood, Los Angeles)</p>
<p>Art fairs provide the opportunity to see the work of a wide range of artists represented by a number of galleries, but what about artists who don&#8217;t have a gallery? This is the concept behind the <a href="http://www.startupartfair.com/" target="_blank">StARTup Art Fair</a>, which began in San Francisco and is now coming to the Highland Gardens Hotel in Hollywood.</p>
<p>This weekend&#8217;s fair will feature 45 artists who are currently between galleries or have never had representation. The fair offers visitors and collectors the chance to discover new artists at the beginning of their careers, with 100% of the sales proceeds going directly to the artists.</p>
<h2><img src="http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hyperbullet.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> FUCK! Loss, desire, pleasure</h2>
<p>When: Opens Saturday, January 30, 6–9pm<br />
Where: ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives (909 W Adams Blvd, University Park, Los Angeles)</p>
<p>Active from 1989 to 1993, boundary-pushing Los Angeles club FUCK! provided a space where body modification, transgressive performance art, and AIDS-related activism all coalesced. The exhibition <em><a href="http://one.usc.edu/fuck-loss-desire-pleasure/" target="_blank">Loss, desire, pleasure</a></em> pays homage to the club&#8217;s legacy, pairing archival material and ephemera with work by contemporary artists who explore themes that first emerged at the club. Participating artists include Jordan Eagles, Siobhan Hebron, Young Joon Kwak, Dominic Quagliozzi, and Daphne Von Rey, who will perform on opening night, piercing and modifying her body and using it as a medium.</p>

<p>Now in its third year, the <a href="http://paramountranch.la/" target="_blank">Paramount Ranch Art Fair</a> provides a counterpoint to the blockbuster <a href="https://artlosangelesfair.com/" target="_blank">Art Los Angeles Contemporary</a> fair in Santa Monica. Held on a ranch used by Paramount studios as a Western set, the fair features an eclectic assortment of emerging galleries, artist-run spaces, and next year&#8217;s art stars including The Box, Del Vaz, Bobby Jesus, Green Gallery, Jennifer Moon and laub, Queer Thoughts, Park View, and many more. Admission is $10 in cash, free for students.</p>

<p>When: Sunday, January 31 — Tuesday, January 2<br />
Where: The Cinefamily (611 North Fairfax Avenue, Fairfax District, Los Angeles)</p>
<p>When David Bowie unexpectedly passed away earlier this month, the world lost an artist whose creative output seemed like it would never end. Throughout his 50-year career, Bowie was constantly reinventing himself; perhaps that is why he appeared perennially youthful. His starring role in Nicholas Roeg&#8217;s 1976 sci-fi masterpiece <em><a href="http://www.cinefamily.org/films/cracked-actor-bowie-on-film/#cracked-actor-bowie-on-film-the-man-who-fell-to-earth" target="_blank">The Man Who Fell to Earth</a></em> bears a marked similarity to his own life. He plays an alien who comes to earth in search of water for his drought-ravaged planet, only to end up a misunderstood and broken man, beaten down by human avarice and alcoholism. Though it takes place over the course of decades, he never seems to age. The film is a visionary, but cautionary tale about human excess, corresponding with a dark, addiction-fueled period in Bowie&#8217;s own life.</p>

(1912 postcard) (via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Old_Spite_House,_Marblehead,_MA.jpg" target="_blank">Wikimedia</a>)</p></div>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spite_house" target="_blank">Spite houses</a> are homes built on anger. They are typically designed to block a neighbor&#8217;s view or sunlight, often with walls aggressively grazing property lines. Whatever their shape, these are structures meant to provoke. A pink house stranded out in a Massachusetts marsh is said to be an exact duplicate of a divorced couple&#8217;s home, erected to fulfill a final agreement, with only saltwater running in its pipes. A claustrophobically narrow house in Virginia was constructed only to block public access to an alleyway.</p>
<p>Spite houses can be found around the world — the 1936 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavanagh_building" target="_blank">Kavanagh Building in Buenos Aires</a>, for example, supposedly achieved its then-status as the tallest skyscraper in Latin America in order to block the church view of a rich family that rejected their son&#8217;s marriage to a less wealthy woman. However, something about the US spirit for private property, for claiming what land you can and keeping strangers off your lawn, seems to have led to a concentration of them in the United States.</p>
<p>In the town where I grew up in Oklahoma, I remember an antique store lodged in an old house that was painted bright pink. The Pepto-Bismol hue riled the neighbors, and the house was eventually whitewashed, but its interior held an enduring act of spite: all the walls were painted the offending shade of pink. Similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holdout_(real_estate)" target="_blank">holdout buildings</a>, like the <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/76597/tooth-and-nail-chinas-resilient-holdouts/" target="_blank">nail houses of China</a> whose owners refused to make way for development, spite houses are acts of protest. Just as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Macefield" target="_blank">Edith Macefield’</a>s petite home in Seattle, a famed holdout which she refused to sell to developers, is now encircled by a massive commercial building (and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/30/us/seattles-little-up-house-faces-razing-after-buyers-back-out.html" target="_blank">threatened by demolition</a>), the houses are statements of their owners&#8217; defiance.</p>

<p>Last month, Kate Bolick wrote about the haunting Pink House on Plum Island in Newburyport, Massachusetts, for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/fashion/plum-islands-pink-house-inspires-a-real-estate-fantasy.html?emc=edit_tnt_20151211&amp;nlid=53098157&amp;tntemail0=y" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em></a>. The house appeared on a forlorn marsh in 1925 when &#8220;a wife agreed to divorce her husband on the condition he build her an exact duplicate of the home they shared in town.&#8221; He grimly held his end of the bargain, but had the copy designed like a readymade ghost of their lost relationship, with no fresh water, just salt, available from its taps. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://savenbptpinkhouse.org/" target="_blank">grassroots campaign</a> underway to protect the Pink House, which is now something of a local icon and threatened by demolition under its ownership by the US Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>

<p>Bolick&#8217;s Pink House article inspired Patrick Sisson at <a href="http://curbed.com/archives/2015/12/14/spite-house-pink-house-plum-house.php" target="_blank">Curbed</a> to round up some of the most famous spite houses, such as the 10-foot-wide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinny_House_(Boston)" target="_blank">Skinny House in Boston</a>, dating to the 19th century, when one brother supposedly build a huge house on the family land, prompting the other brother to add his own tiny house and <a href="http://www.celebrateboston.com/strange/skinny-house.htm" target="_blank">mask the view</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a rainbow-painted house in Topeka, Kansas, right across from the homophobic Westboro Baptist Church, a house striped like a candy cane in a wealthy London neighborhood in reaction to its owner&#8217;s renovation plans being shot down by neighbors (although the paint was ordered removed by the Kensington and Chelsea Council <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/red-stripes-on-15m-kensington-townhouse-must-be-removed-council-orders-10209339.html" target="_blank">last year)</a>, and the seven-foot-wide <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/29/travel/escapes/29away.html" target="_blank">Spite House of Alexandria, Virginia</a>, built by John Hollensbury to keep people out of his alley (according to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/29/travel/escapes/29away.html" target="_blank">the <em>New York Times</em></a>, the living room has the alleyway&#8217;s brick walls, which have holes still visible from the hubs of wagon wheels).</p>

<p>Generally, the aim of these homes&#8217; builders was not habitation, as is the case with the 1815 <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-29/travel/tr-41_1_spite-house" target="_blank">Tyler Spite House in Frederick, Maryland</a>, built by Dr. John Tyler to stop a road from being built through his property. According to <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-29/travel/tr-41_1_spite-house" target="_blank">the <em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>, when he found a local law that could stop the street if there was a big building project, he had a foundation put in place <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZIinZBE2BoC&amp;pg=PT479&amp;dq=tyler+spite+house&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjmvqWwoHKAhVFLB4KHV9yATUQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=tyler%20spite%20house&amp;f=false" target="_blank">overnight</a> and it was discovered by a befuddled construction crew the next morning. The road still stops abruptly at the house&#8217;s doorstep.</p>

<p>New York City once had an infamous spite house at 82nd Street and Lexington Avenue. The 1882 <a href="http://www.nyc-architecture.com/GON/GON005.htm" target="_blank">Richardson Spite House</a> came to be when Joseph Richardson was insulted by a neighbor&#8217;s meager offer for his land. He <a href="http://www.nyc-architecture.com/GON/GON005.htm" target="_blank">reportedly</a> proclaimed: &#8220;I shall build me a couple of tall houses on the little strip which will bar the light from Sarner&#8217;s windows overlooking my land, and he&#8217;ll find he would have profited had he paid me the $5,000.&#8221; It was finally torn down after a 1915 sale (Daytonian in Manhattan <a href="http://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-lost-1882-spite-house-no-1215.html" target="_blank">has a thorough recap</a> of the lost building&#8217;s history).</p>
<div id="attachment_264846" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-264846" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/spitehouse12.jpg" alt="The Richardson Spite House demolished in 1915, which once stood at Lexington Avenue and 82nd Street (1915) (via Wikimedia)" width="640" height="579" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/spitehouse12-199x180.jpg 199w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/spitehouse12-768x695.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/spitehouse12.jpg 909w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Richardson Spite House being demolished in 1915.

<p>There are numerous other examples, like <a href="http://www.newstimes.com/living/article/Sad-story-behind-cake-box-structure-in-135701.php" target="_blank">the Cake House in Gaylordsville</a>, which resembles a precarious tower of houses growing smaller and smaller until its top. Legend <a href="http://www.newstimes.com/living/article/Sad-story-behind-cake-box-structure-in-135701.php" target="_blank">has it</a> that it was built in protest of the owner&#8217;s foster daughter&#8217;s baby being taken away by the state. Much like the belated <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/67001/saying-goodbye-to-a-brooklyn-diy-architectural-marvel/" target="_blank">Broken Angel in Brooklyn</a>, its unconventional form is an architectural provocation against the homes around it.</p>

<p>There are also commercial spite houses, like the twin wooden <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Hills_Towers" target="_blank">Irish Hills Towers</a> in Cambridge Township, Michigan. Although they&#8217;re attached now (and in a vulnerable situation <a href="http://www.lenconnect.com/article/20151006/NEWS/151009480" target="_blank">due to a proposed demolition</a>), the two observation towers were built separately. One was constructed in 1924 by the Michigan Observation Company, the other by a farmer who owned the other half of the bluff. The both kept building higher, one called &#8220;Original Irish Hills Tower,&#8221; the other &#8220;Gray Tower.&#8221; The nearly conjoined rivals were only connected by a new owner in the 1950s.</p>

<p>City ordinances on light access and fire regulations for such narrow buildings mean spite houses can&#8217;t be built as easily today, and those that survive face preservation issues. Last year, a late 19th-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spite_fence" target="_blank">spite wall</a> — a huge swoop of stone on a Wicker Park greystone in Chicago hiding the Victorian home from a hated neighbor — <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150527/wicker-park/removal-of-wicker-park-greystones-spite-wall-alarms-neighbors-fans" target="_blank">was removed</a>. It can be hard to love houses built on hate, whose designs were guided by rage. Yet these are unique acts of architecture, reminders that a home is after all a symbol of its occupant&#8217;s place in the world, and these represent the legacies of people who refused to settle for the status quo.</p>

<p>PARIS — Like a good student of the bottomless pit of fashion, <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/tag/ai-weiwei/" target="_blank">Ai Weiwei</a> has delivered big on his latest class assignment. His all-white (per the store’s request) tribute to classical Chinese heritage spans <a href="http://www.lebonmarche.com/en.html" target="_blank">Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche</a>’s display windows on Rue de Sèvres, two atriums, and a special exhibition gallery on the main floor of the chic department store. The show, <em><a href="http://www.lebonmarche.com/evenements/ai-weiwei.html" target="_blank">Er Xi, Air de Jeu</a></em> (or “Playground”), dovetails with the retail space’s White Sale, an annual promotional event started by Le Bon Marché founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristide_Boucicaut" target="_blank">Aristide Boucicaut</a> (1810–1877). But where cringing celebrity optimization meets big money, can there be serious art?</p>
<p>Like any corporate activity, <em>Er Xi</em> whitewashes overly difficult personal style. Although enjoyable as silly fun and artisan bamboo craft, the exhibition lacks anything recognizable as art and makes no political statement. It&#8217;s a conceptual disappointment within the post-<a href="http://hyperallergic.com/173249/four-cartoonists-among-12-dead-in-attack-on-french-satirical-magazine/" target="_blank">Je Suis Charlie</a> and post-<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34818994" target="_blank">November 13</a> Parisian context. It may be good corporate scenic ornamentation and crowd-pleasing luxury design, but it is not (political) art.</p>
<div id="attachment_270645" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ai-weiwei-bon-marche-paris-03.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-270645"><img class="wp-image-270645" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ai-weiwei-bon-marche-paris-03.jpg" alt="Ai Weiwei and Paris Hilton at the opening of Ai's 'Er Xi, Air de jeux' at Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche (photo © Say Who, courtesy Le Bon Marché)" width="320" height="213" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ai-weiwei-bon-marche-paris-03-270x180.jpg 270w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ai-weiwei-bon-marche-paris-03-768x512.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ai-weiwei-bon-marche-paris-03-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ai-weiwei-bon-marche-paris-03.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ai Weiwei and Paris Hilton at the opening of Ai&#8217;s &#8216;Er Xi, Air de jeux&#8217; at Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche (photo © Say Who, courtesy Le Bon Marché) (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>Sipping Moët at the opening made this elegant and ironic playground tolerable, though I forgot to <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/46271/sundance-ai-weiwei-alison-klayman/" target="_blank">reverently flip the bird at Ai</a> as he was giving television interviews. The lightweight socialite Paris Hilton breezed into his radical-chic installation surrounded by bodyguards. Where was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Wolfe" target="_blank">Tom Wolfe</a> now that we could use him, I wondered?</p>
<p>This is Ai’s first visit to Paris since 2003, and his biggest solo project here since a major show <a href="http://www.jeudepaume.org/?page=article&amp;idArt=1500" target="_blank">at the Jeu de Paume in 2012</a>. In corporate speak, <em>Er Xi </em>strives for resonance, but even as a merger move it lacks the distinctive style needed for effective branding. Ai is the essence of a political firebrand, but his suspended atrium creatures could be part of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. These cute baubles are not what we think of when we consider Ai’s brave political acts and statements (though I give him credit for going to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/12071454/Migrant-crisis-Chinese-artist-Ai-Weiwei-visits-Lesbos-refugees.html" target="_blank">witness the refugee crisis firsthand</a> on the Greek island of Lesbos). What we see here is Ai double-tracking his public image: defining himself through committed political art on the one hand, but on the other demonstrating allegiance to moneyed, brand-conscious commerce.</p>

<p>The window displays on Rue de Sèvres are the best part of <em>Er Xi</em>. They have the same feel of neurology that drawings sometimes attain. Certain forms and figures are constructed by exposing their bamboo framework, while others are wrapped in white silk. They feature mythological scenes, highlights from Ai’s own oeuvre, and shameful homages to the brilliant, non-commercial art of Marcel Duchamp.</p>
<div id="attachment_270649" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ai-weiwei-bon-marche-paris-07.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-270649"><img class="wp-image-270649" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ai-weiwei-bon-marche-paris-07.jpg" alt="Installation view of Ai Weiwei's 'Er Xi, Air de jeux' at Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche" width="320" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ai-weiwei-bon-marche-paris-07-135x180.jpg 135w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ai-weiwei-bon-marche-paris-07-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ai-weiwei-bon-marche-paris-07.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Installation view of Ai Weiwei&#8217;s &#8216;Er Xi, Air de jeux&#8217; at Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>All the pieces in <em>Er Xi </em>are labor-intensive, handcrafted in a studio in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weifang#Kite_flying" target="_blank">Shandong</a>, but extremely lightweight — both literally and conceptually. In the atrium, fairy-like creatures representing mythic characters from the text of <em>Shan Hai Jing </em>(or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Mountains_and_Seas">Classic of Mountains and Seas</a>”) float above the cosmetics concessions. Adopting the technique of traditional kite-making, Ai selected around 24 characters and mythological creatures to be rendered using the ancient method. Articulated through the flexibility of bamboo sticks and lightweight white silk are moments from epic Chinese tales and popular legends that date back to classical antiquity. The exhibition’s <em>pièce de résistance</em> is a large dragon constructed in four segments snaking through a ground-level gallery.</p>
<p>In the “classy” black-and-white video loop projected near the dragon, Ai is seen inspecting his studio artisans’ fabrication of the bamboo kite creatures. He then recounts how Paris represents a creative haven for the rest of the world: the place of Rimbaud, Apollinaire, the Impressionists, Surrealists, and Dadadists. It’s a gracious tip of the hat, but it also reaffirms that if Ai hopes to join such ranks — and not merely stick a whitewashed version of his self-mythologizing schtick into a window onto that history — he best back off decorating tony department stores and get back to the grittier business of addressing sociopolitical issues.</p>

<p>This week is filled with openings and events that will get you thinking — about the Citi Bike as readymade, the role of the curator in artwashing, the way you eat and play, parenting in the art world, and more.</p>
<h2><img src="http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hyperbullet.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> Citi Bike as Readymade</h2>
<p>When: Opens Wednesday, January 27<br />
Where: ISCP (1040 Metropolitan Avenue, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn)</p>
<p>Countless artists have revisited the idea of readymade in the century since Duchamp, but Nobutaka Aozaki’s approach is particularly compelling. For every day of <a href="http://cargocollective.com/staging/Stage-3-Nobutaka-Aozaki-Transportation" target="_blank">this brief exhibition</a>, curated by Rachael Rakes, Aozaki will rent, exhibit, and then return a Citi Bike from a dock near ISCP. In the gallery the bike will be displayed on a raised white platform, prompting all kinds of musings on the intersections of culture and capitalism. And Aozaki will accrue fees and fines during the run of the show, raising questions about the way our rental systems are rigged.</p>
<h2><img src="http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hyperbullet.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> Hito Steyerl in Free Fall</h2>
<p>When: Wednesday, January 27, 10:30am–6pm &amp; Friday, January 29, 10:30am–10pm<br />
Where: Whitney Museum of American Art (99 Gansevoort Street, Meatpacking District, Manhattan)</p>
<p>Having recently watched Hito Steyerl&#8217;s excellent &#8220;<a href="http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/may/31/hito-steyerl-how-not-to-be-seen/" target="_blank">How Not To Be Seen. A Fucking Didactic Educational .MOV File</a>&#8221; (2013), a beguiling and amusing take on our image-saturated world, I&#8217;m intrigued to see &#8220;<a href="http://whitney.org/Events/InFreeFall" target="_blank">In Free Fall</a>&#8221; (2010), in which the artist follows the life cycle of a Boeing 707 from its construction to its eventual scrapping. &#8220;In doing so,&#8221; states the Whitney Museum&#8217;s event page, &#8220;Steyerl traces tangled economies through the life of a commodity.&#8221; The plane that Steyerl investigates was apparently purchased for Israeli military operations and later used on the set of Jan de Bont&#8217;s Hollywood thriller <em>Speed</em> (1994). It all sounds a bit too crazy to be true. <i>—TM</i></p>
<h2><img src="http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hyperbullet.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> Learning Object Lessons</h2>
<div id="attachment_270639" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-270639" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/slack-imgs.com_.jpeg" alt="The cover of Alison Kinney's 'Hood,' part of the 'Object Lessons' series" width="320" height="463" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The cover of Alison Kinney&#8217;s &#8216;Hood,&#8217; part of the &#8216;Object Lessons&#8217; series (via <a href="http://objectsobjectsobjects.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/9781501307409-707x1024.jpeg" target="_blank">objectsobjectsobjects.com</a>)</p></div>
<p>When: Thursday, January 28, 7–8:30pm<br />
Where: McNally Jackson (52 Prince Street, Nolita, Manhattan)</p>
<p>Bloomsbury and <i>The Atlantic</i> have collaborated on a new series that turns the object lesson into a piece of writing, either essay or book. The result is a series of idiosyncratic disquisitions on &#8220;objects&#8221; as varied as the drone, the driver&#8217;s license, and silence.</p>
<p>To help officially launch the series, on Thursday night three writers of such lessons — Hyperallergic contributor <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/author/alison-kinney/" target="_blank">Alison Kinney</a>, Lydia Pyne, and Kim Adrian — will <a href="http://www.mcnallyjackson.com/event/object-lessons-alison-kinney-lydia-pyne-and-kim-adrian-moderated-emily-firetog-lit-hub" target="_blank">discuss their respective objects</a>: the hood, the bookshelf, and the sock. The presentations will, of course, include visuals.</p>

<h2><img src="http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hyperbullet.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> What Is Artwashing?</h2>
<p>When: Thursday, January 28, 6:30–8:30pm<br />
Where: CP Projects Space (132 W 21st Street, Chelsea, Manhattan)</p>
<p>Though not quite as prevalent as greenwashing, &#8220;artwashing&#8221; has gained visibility as a dirty word over the last two decades, with companies in industries including tobacco, weapons manufacturing, and oil extraction trying to boost their sullied corporate images through conspicuous cultural sponsorship. Being that we&#8217;re in New York, where real estate dominates and dictates everything, this <a href="http://www.sva.edu/events/events-exhibitions/articulating-artwashing-gentrification-and-responsibility-what-is-the-place-of-the-curator" target="_blank">panel</a> organized by SVA&#8217;s MA Curatorial Practice program will address how the companies benefiting from development and gentrification use and support art and artists, as well as the role of curators — two of whom, No Longer Empty&#8217;s Manon Slome and the Shelly &amp; Donald Rubin Foundation&#8217;s Sara Reisman, will participate — in that dynamic. <i>—BS</i></p>

<h2><img src="http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hyperbullet.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> Four Movements for Essex Hemphill</h2>
<p>When: Friday, January 29, 7pm<br />
Where: BHQFU (33 34th Street, Sunset Park, Brooklyn)</p>
<p>This past December 1, aka World AIDS Day, aka Day With(out) Art, filmmaker and artist Tiona McClodden took over the website of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, with a tribute to Essex Hemphill. “<a href="http://icaphila.org/programs/7570/day-with-out-art-af-fixing-ceremony-four-movements-for-essex" target="_blank">Af·fixing Ceremony: Four Movements for Essex”</a> is a powerful multimedia introduction to the work of the poet and activist, who died of AIDS-related complications in 1995, at the age of 38. When I encountered it, I was captivated from the very first lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was counting T-cells on the shores of cyberspace and feeling some despair&#8230;. I have miscegenated and mutated, tolerated and assimilated and yet I remain the same in the eyes of those who would fear and despise me. I stand at the threshold of cyberspace and wonder, is it possible that I am unwelcome here, too?</p></blockquote>
<p>Friday night offers the chance to hear <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1536999383265009/" target="_blank">McClodden present and discuss</a> the project, as well as Hemphill’s legacy, in more depth.</p>
<h2><img src="http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hyperbullet.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> Meal of Fortune</h2>

<p>When: Friday, January 29–Saturday, January 31, 7:30–10pm<br />
Where: Babycastles Gallery (137 W 14th Street, Chelsea, Manhattan)</p>
<p>Presented by Mouth Arcade, this <a href="http://www.moutharcade.com/mealoffortune" target="_blank">immersive event</a> will examine our daily rituals of eating with a four-course meal and a paired series of games (digital and analogue) — which sounds like a pretty ideal way to spend an evening. Theory Kitchen&#8217;s Theo Friedman is in charge of satisfying tastebuds, while artists Thu Tran and Will Rahilly will deal with the entertainment program. Attendees will also be introduced to three new games, all edible, so arrive with an empty stomach and your A game. <i>—CV</i></p>
<h2><img src="http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hyperbullet.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> Performing Snow</h2>
<p>When: Friday, January 29 &amp; Saturday, January 30, 7:30pm<br />
Where: The Invisible Dog (51 Bergen Street, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn)<br />
Snow can transform the most ordinary of city blocks into something temporarily magical, when quiet falls over everything and sweeping waves of white shroud the street. Reimagining elements from Hans Christian Andersen&#8217;s &#8220;The Snow Queen&#8221; and the transformative power of the winter weather, <em><a href="http://theinvisibledog.org/snow/" target="_blank">Snow</a> </em>is a multimedia performance piece involving music, dance, and puppetry. Tiny instruments by toy pianist Phyllis Chen, instruments invented by Ranjit Bhatnagar, and masks by Nina Barlow accompany dance and unexpected movement, as choreographed by Jordan Morley with music by John Glover. <i>—AM</i></p>
<h2><img src="http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/hyperbullet.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> Parenting in the Art World</h2>

<p>When: Opens Saturday, January 30, 2–4pm<br />
Where: EFA Project Space (323 West 39th Street, Garment District, Manhattan)</p>
<p>Discussions of feminism abound in the art world of late, but something these conversations often leave out is the question of parenting — or <i>questions</i>, really, of whether the space where you’re showing your work <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/89980/an-artist-takes-feminism-to-the-stoops/" target="_blank">offers child care</a>, whether you can bring your kids to the residency you’ve been offered, whether you’ll have to give up your career if you’re interested in having a family, and many more. <a href="http://www.projectspace-efanyc.org/the-let-down-reflex/" target="_blank"><i>The Let Down Reflex</i></a>, a group show curated Amber Berson and Juliana Driever at EFA Project Space, “attempts to recognize the complexities of parenting in the art world, and asks if a better alternative for families can exist.” I’m eager to hear what these artists have to say and see what they suggest.</p>

<p>Charles Saatchi, head of the eponymous <a href="http://www.saatchigallery.com/" target="_blank">Saatchi Gallery</a> in London, doesn&#8217;t exactly have the best feminist track record. In 2013, a scandal erupted after <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/10533047/Nigella-Lawson-and-Charles-Saatchi-the-remarkably-messed-up-life-of-two-remarkable-people.html" target="_blank">photos surfaced</a> of the multimillionaire advertising tycoon with his hand clenched around the neck of his then-wife, Nigella Lawson. And though it arguably helped launched the careers of female Young British Artists (YBAs) like Tracey Emin and Sarah Lucas, Saatchi Gallery itself (like most major art galleries) has a history of disproportionately featuring men: a <a href="http://www.saatchigallery.com/gallery/exhibits.htm" target="_blank">list highlighting artists who&#8217;ve shown there</a> includes only one woman (Agnes Martin) in the gallery&#8217;s first three years (1985–88).</p>
<p>Now, on its 30th anniversary, Saatchi Gallery is apparently trying to correct this pattern. Its first all-women art exhibit, called <em><a href="http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/champagne-life/" target="_blank">Champagne Life</a>, </em>features the work of 14 &#8220;emerging&#8221; practitioners. Named for a Warhol-esque 2014 work by artist <a href="http://juliawachtel.com/" target="_blank">Julia Wachtel</a>, which mashes up photos of Minnie Mouse, Kanye West, and Kim Kardashian, &#8220;<em>Champagne Life</em> celebrates the work of a constellation of female artists, and provides a rare and apposite moment to reflect on what it means to be a female artist working today,” reads a vaguely self-congratulatory <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/champagne-life-showcases-women-artists-at-saatchi-gallery" target="_blank">press release</a>. &#8220;This exhibition will play an important role in approaching issues of the glass ceiling that applies to the art world as much as to the world at large.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking through images of the artworks online, it seems that many of the pieces are impressive in their technique and scale, and many of these artists deserve to continue emerging in the coming years, as so many Saatchi-discovered talents have. But content-wise, the show as a whole doesn&#8217;t offer any particularly groundbreaking reflections on &#8220;issues of the glass ceiling&#8221; or &#8220;what it means to be a female artist working today.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_270732" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mequitta-Ahuja1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-270732"><img class="wp-image-270732" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mequitta-Ahuja1.jpg" alt="Mequitta Ahuja, &quot;Rhyme Sequence: Wiggle Waggle&quot; (2012), oil, paper, and acrylic on canvas, 213 x 203 cm (click to enlarge)" width="320" height="338" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mequitta-Ahuja1-768x810.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mequitta-Ahuja1-971x1024.jpg 971w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mequitta-Ahuja1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mequitta Ahuja, &#8220;Rhyme Sequence: Wiggle Waggle&#8221; (2012), oil, paper, and acrylic on canvas, 213 x 203 cm (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>The work on view is, as far as I can tell, thematically unrelated. It ranges from a couple of hefty animal sculptures — Isle of Man–based artist <a href="http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/stephanie_quayle.htm" target="_blank">Stephanie Quayle</a>&#8216;s life-size clay sculptures of two brown cows and Iranian Goldsmiths student <a href="http://www.soheila-sokhanvari.com/" target="_blank">Soheila Sokhanvari</a>&#8216;s taxidermy horse straddling a balloon — to Serbian artist <a href="http://www.jelenabulajic.com/" target="_blank">Jelena Bulajić</a>’s hyperrealistic portraits of elderly people, meticulously rendered in marble dust, ground granite, limestone, and kaolin. Particularly striking are the fantastical paintings of Baltimore-based artist <a href="http://www.mequittaahuja.com/" target="_blank">Mequitta Ahuja</a> that incorporate imagery from ancient myths, including the 15th-century Persian manuscript <em>The Hamzanama</em>, and Hindu miniature paintings.</p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s a sign of progress that a major gallery is making an effort to correct for centuries of gender disparity. But instead of attempting to really look at &#8220;what it means to be a female artist,&#8221; this particular exhibit, in which the artworks are united only by the gender of their creators, comes off as a kind of PR stunt. Imagine a show in which the only curatorial principle is that all the featured artists are male, and you start to see how absurd the premise is.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">some prominent art critics are patting Saatchi on the back, hailing the show as important. Mark Hudson at the </span><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/what-to-see/champagne-life-saatchi-gallery-review-heartening-news-for-art/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegraph</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> called it “heartening news for art.” (In disheartening news for art criticism, he couldn’t resist comparing the work of most of the female artists included to that of much better-known male artists: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jelena Bulajić is kind of like </span><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/9724849/Chuck-Close-gets-up-close-and-personal.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Close</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzanne McClelland’s abstractions are </span><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art-obituaries/8620297/Cy-Twombly.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cy Twombly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> derivatives.) And in t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he</span><i> </i><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/jan/06/saatchi-gallery-all-female-exhibition-shift-male-gaze-art-world"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guardian</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Jonathan Jones declared that “Saatchi Gallery’s all-female art show could start to shift the male gaze of the art world.”  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to shift? Giving the male-run, corporate-sponsored Saatchi Gallery credit for initiating such a change is to discredit decades of previous work by feminist artists and activists fighting for gender equality. Judy Chicago made her landmark work &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/dinner_party" target="_blank">The Dinner Party</a>&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1975. The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_Girls" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guerrilla Girls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been pushing for better representation of female artists in galleries and museums since 1985. (Though it&#8217;s only now that they&#8217;re getting their message to a mainstream mass audience via a <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/269192/a-few-things-you-wont-learn-from-stephen-colberts-interview-with-the-guerrilla-girls/" target="_blank">recent appearance on <em>The Late Show</em></a>.) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston hosted <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inside-Visible-Elliptical-Traverse-Twentieth/dp/0262540819" target="_blank">Inside the Visible</a>,</em> a major survey of 30 women artists, in 1997. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything, Saatchi Gallery is late to the party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Adrian Searle <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/12/champagne-life-review-all-female-exhibition-saatchi-no-feminist?CMP=share_btn_tw" target="_blank">writes in his review</a> of <em>Champagne Life </em>in the <em>Guardian</em>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Mounting an all-female exhibition doesn’t make Charles Saatchi a feminist. Nothing could. Saatchi himself has become a kind of sacred monster. Although rarely seen in the galleries, he casts a long shadow over the whole enterprise. Did someone suggest this show would help him to improve his image? An all-female lineup is intrinsically no more interesting than an all-male roster of swinging dicks, especially when it has no larger thematic purpose.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of patting itself on the back for hosting a thematically vague exhibition of women artists, shouldn’t the gallery be a little embarrassed that it&#8217;s taken 30 years to make a concerted effort to embrace gender diversity? Why is showcasing women’s work still such a rare event?</span></p>

<p>The well-known Delhi Art Gallery’s capacious new space in New York’s prestigious Fuller Building brings Indian modernists to a Western audience. Featuring members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_Progressive_Artists%27_Group" target="_blank">Progressive Artists&#8217; Group</a> (PGA) of the 1950s, artists from the Bengal School in Santiniketan, and others making art post-independence in 1947, the gallery’s large repertoire focuses on work that was determined to break away from British academic training.</p>
<div id="attachment_270686" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/AraKH31.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-270686"><img class="wp-image-270686" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/AraKH31.jpg" alt="K.

H. Ara, &#8220;Untitled,&#8221; gouache on paper, 30.2 x 22 inches (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>The current group exhibition, titled <em><a href="http://dagmodern.com/exhibitions-images.asp?id=123&amp;exType=EXH" target="_blank">The Naked and the Nude</a></em>, makes a distinction between portrayals of the “naked” and the “nude” body in Indian modern art. Traditionally, the bare figure was depicted in erotic sculptures on the facades of ancient Indian temples like Khajuraho and Konark in the 12th and 13th centuries. The culture celebrated nakedness as an icon of purity and the attainment of bliss as per the precepts of the <em>Kama Sutra</em>. But prudish Victorian norms tainted the act of looking, making the ancient Indian nude body a salacious voyeur’s delight. The catalogue essay attempts to separate the paintings in the exhibition into two categories: works that depict the ancient virtuous body and those with a vulgar slant. Yet the best artworks in this sprawling exhibition, which covers the years 1957–2006, are the ones that deal with the dilemma by combining the consecrated and the sacrilegious with a passion that’s collectively significant and singularly distinctive.</p>
<p>For members of the PGA like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._F._Husain" target="_blank">M.F. Husain</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._H._Ara" target="_blank">K.H. Ara</a>, both of whom were both self- taught artists, the body finds a home between the two categories. In Husain’s early untitled and undated series of drawings on Conte paper, yellow angular lines resembling outstretched limbs suggest sexual coupling. Even his “Untitled” (1965) grisaille painting that recalls an abstract Cubist landscape reveals two men in sexual embrace. Influenced by the ideals of sexual union in ancient Hindu texts, Husain’s understated, subtle imagery captures the concept of physical intimacy just as well as Ara’s oversized, zaftig women representing fertility. Like the Venus of Willendorf, Ara’s female figures have large, childbearing hips and sumptuous thighs. Yet these goddesses of fecundity fill their frames without the prurience of Manet’s Olympia or even Titian’s Urbino. Situated in a strangely alluring but only partially sexual realm, both artists find a visual language that incorporates both chaste and licentious iconography.</p>
<div id="attachment_270688" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChandraA118.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-270688"><img class="wp-image-270688" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChandraA118.jpg" alt="Avinash Chandra, &quot;Untitled&quot; (1963), waterproof ink and pen and ink on paper pasted on paper, 29.7 x 21.5 inches (click to enlarge)" width="320" height="434" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChandraA118-768x1042.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChandraA118-755x1024.jpg 755w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ChandraA118.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Avinash Chandra, &#8220;Untitled&#8221; (1963), waterproof ink and pen and ink on paper pasted on paper, 29.7 x 21.5 inches (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>Avinash Chandra similarly renders the corporal and the sublime together, here in two large, unique paintings replete with his unmistakable squiggles. In his untitled painting of 1963 made with acrylic, water color, pastel, and markers on linen, cartoon-like figures that recall the work of George Condo appear amid a frenzied swirl of lines. An abundance of oddly shaped breasts and phalluses can be seen within the curved flourishes, suggesting an environment of free sex reminiscent of the Beat Generation and 1960s Woodstock. Chandra’s highly suggestive imagery is both humorous and charged, and it embraces sexuality while forgoing overtly sensuous excesses.</p>
<p>Notions of beauty and sexuality are deeply entwined with intimations of human suffering in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogen_Chowdhury" target="_blank">Jogen Chowdhury</a>’s work. His contorted female figures drawn with pastel on paper are influenced by Indian tribal art and seem to harness the power of the goddess Kali, Grotesque and unappealing, his palpably raw forms emit an energy that feels almost destructive. Similarly, the twisted female body in an untitled 1975 work by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokash_Karmakar" target="_blank">Prokash Karmakar</a> has large, pomegranate-like breasts and a distended belly; it is as suffused with feminine vitality as it is repulsive.</p>

<p>The dual aspect of the works that conjoin Hindu idealism with modern sexual potency becomes more complex in paintings by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxma_Goud" target="_blank">Laxma Goud</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Das" target="_blank">Sunil Das</a>. Goud combines a sense of oneness with all creatures, derived from growing up in rural India, with an uncurtailed libido. His stirring animal forms in pen and ink are surreal, erotic, satyr-like shapes with muscular legs, tails, and multiple breasts (recalling Louise Bourgeoisie sculptures) — they exude the fearlessness and savagery of Greek mythological figures. Likewise, Das has a fantastical creature drawn with ink in 1972 that emerges from a profusion of curved dark lines resembling a nimbus cloud. With multiple limbs, udder-like breasts, a phallus, and bulging masses of flesh, this wild, headless creature exhibits a carnal force. By presenting the idea of sexuality through these unreal, imagined figures, both artists are able to more easily oscillate between the realm of the virtuous and the vulgar.</p>

<p>This discussion — and exhibition — would be incomplete without including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Newton_Souza" target="_blank">F.N. Souza</a>, the founder of the PGA and the bad boy of pornographic art. His explicitly sexual sketches and paintings of couples copulating, as well as his deliberately titillating renderings of the <em>Kama Sutra</em>, place Souza’s work squarely in the nude, raunchy category. However, the distinction between the naked and the nude in the exhibition mostly falls short. As much as one can argue to the contrary in theory, in reality the Indian modernists found their voices through their very ability to combine the tenets of ancient Indian iconography with more contemporary forms. In fact, the show’s triumph lies in presenting artists whose works attest to the vigorousness of this mix. With a smaller, tighter selection of paintings, the viewer might better understand the fallacy of this distinction and the great value of works that combine the two.</p>

<p>A century ago, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Trans-Antarctic_Expedition">Endurance Expedition</a> to Antarctica was stranded on the remote, frigid continent, their ship shattered and hope for rescue slim. Led by explorer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton">Ernest Shackleton</a>, the expedition crew managed to survive through an 800-mile journey on a small 22-foot ship. The experience is considered the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroic_Age_of_Antarctic_Exploration">Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration</a>, which included international competitions to reach the South Pole, and work across country borders to research the unexplored landmass.</p>

<p>Antarctica remains a powerful place of international collaboration for survival in one of the planet&#8217;s most extreme environments. To encourage public awareness of the ongoing role of Antarctica in global cooperation, especially in the scientific research on climate change (this is where the Ozone Hole <a href="http://www.atm.ch.cam.ac.uk/tour/part1.html">was discovered</a>), in 2008 France-based artist duo <a href="http://www.studio-orta.com/en/lucy-jorge-orta">Lucy and Jorge Orta</a> launched the mobile <em>Antarctica World Passport Delivery Bureau,</em> where anyone can pledge citizenship to the southernmost continent. The Bureau is currently in operation at Jane Lombard Gallery in conjunction with <em><a href="http://www.janelombardgallery.com/current">Antarctica</a></em>, their first New York City solo show. (You can also request a virtual passport <a href="http://www.antarcticaworldpassport.com./en/">online</a>.)</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t actually <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/oct/23/antarctica.essentialinfo">need a passport</a> to visit Antarctica, as the 1959 <a href="http://www.ats.aq/e/ats.htm">Antarctic Treaty</a>, now signed by 53 nation states, affirmed it as a peaceful territory free from country ownership. The <a href="http://www.antarcticaworldpassport.com./en/">Antarctica World Passport</a> is completely symbolic, an advocacy tool to engage people around the world in the importance of a remote place most of us will never visit. Before Jane Lombard Gallery, the Bureau was <a href="http://www.artcop21.com/events/antarctica-world-passport-delivery-bureau/">at the Grand Palais</a> in Paris alongside December&#8217;s COP21 UN Climate Summit.</p>

<p>Lucy and Jorge Orta made their own expedition to Antarctica in 2007 for the first <a href="http://www.biennialfoundation.org/biennials/biennial-at-the-end-of-the-world/">End of the World Biennial</a>, a collaboration between the Patagonia Arte y Desafío Foundation and the Parlamento Latinoamericano of San Pablo Memorial Foundation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushuaia">Ushuaia</a>, Argentina, considered the world&#8217;s southernmost city. Much of the <em>Antarctica</em> exhibition focuses on the temporary &#8220;Antarctic Village &#8211; No Borders&#8221; they constructed on that expedition, including one of the 50 dome tents adorned with the flags of nations that signed the Antarctic Treaty. During the 2007 journey, the Ortas raised an &#8220;Antarctica Flag&#8221; designed with all these vibrant flags merged together.</p>
<p>There are also preparatory drawings for the &#8220;village&#8221; and colorful &#8220;survival kits&#8221; from 2008, with life vests adorned with objects like water flasks, children&#8217;s shoes, cooking utensils, and various other survival items. There isn&#8217;t much explanation for their meaning alongside the less conceptual passports, but they feel like totems of the same optimism driving that project. If you peek at the purple striped canoe on the assemblage &#8220;OrtaWater &#8211; Antarctica&#8221; (2006), you&#8217;ll discover a model of a human heart is riding in the vessel.</p>

<p>In the utopic vision of the Ortas, Antarctica is a last refuge from global conflict and its rigid borders, where anyone can belong, and the only way to survive is through collaboration. Come 2048, the 1991<a href="http://www.antarctica.gov.au/law-and-treaty/the-madrid-protocol"> Madrid Protocol</a> that prohibits mining in Antarctica will be up for review, and the resources buried beneath the icy surface may be too enticing for corporations. Climate change, like this distant, southern tip of our world, can often feel abstract, but Lucy and Jorge Orta are hoping to engage people with its importance, one passport at a time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CHICAGO — The 96th installment of a <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/tag/a-view-from-the-easel/" target="_blank">series</a> in which artists send in a photo and a description of their workspace. Want to take part? Submit your studio — just check out the <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/47316/submit-your-workspace-to-a-view-from-the-easel/" target="_blank">submission guidelines</a>.</p>
<h2>Kharis Kennedy, St. Croix, US Virgin Islands (<a href="http://khariskennedy.com/">site</a>)</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-270791" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Studio-picture-Kharis-Kennedy.jpg" alt="Studio-picture-Kharis-Kennedy" width="640" height="467" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Studio-picture-Kharis-Kennedy-247x180.jpg 247w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Studio-picture-Kharis-Kennedy-768x560.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Studio-picture-Kharis-Kennedy-1024x747.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Studio-picture-Kharis-Kennedy.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Because it is crucial that I am always the youngest and thinnest person in the room I keep the doors to my studio locked to ensure that no one else can get in. The competition is relentless: I live on an island in the Caribbean and as many as two to three tourists per month get lost, find themselves stranded in the courtyard that my studio shares with a few other businesses, and knock plaintively on my glass doors.</p>
<p>The vibe in these historic walls is voodoo and this permeates my paintings. The vibe in my head is fashion. Currently this leaves me no choice but to paint animals and humans who not only model haute couture but also radiate an intuitive spirituality.</p>

<p>I have a live-work space in the Artspace Tannery Lofts at the Tannery Arts Center. My unit is one of the smallest in this 100-unit development, considered a “studio” as in “studio apartment.” Because I am on the top floor, I have a 14’ ceiling which has allowed me to build up. The beams in the top of this photo are the supports for my sleeping loft. I took the photo from the “living” end of the loft. My 14 foot high x 10 foot wide painting wall is to the right. My work table and some storage are to the left with more storage in the space above the bathroom and closet. The light from six clerestories is exceptional most afternoons.</p>
<p>Living in one room with my work from start to finish allows me extended time to think, dream, fuss, change, and explore.</p>
<h2>Dawnice Kerchaert, Pontiac, Michigan (<a href="http://dawniceKsculptor.com">site</a>)</h2>

<p>One side of my studio space is set up for metal fabrication and the other side is filled with natural materials I have gathered, plus few other things I might use. I like to work on multiple things at a time so I value table space. The process is grungy and sometimes noisy. I have had this space for about three years. Previously my studio was in a smaller basement space, so the natural light here is another bonus.</p>
<h2>Emily Klima, Long Island City, New York (<a href="http://www.emk-art.com/">site</a>)</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-270794" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/klima.jpg" alt="klima" width="640" height="243" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/klima-291x110.jpg 291w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/klima-768x292.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/klima-1024x389.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/klima.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>This photo is a panoramic view of my studio. Behind me is a couch and sink against a huge window with northwest and southwest light exposure and music — always music playing! My very awesome table that I acquired when I moved in on the left is a large and very heavy work table for mixing, collaging, pouring, and sketching smaller paintings or works on paper. The ceilings are very high allowing me to hang a lot of my finished paintings for open studio and appointment visits. It&#8217;s very comfortable and peaceful in my &#8220;happy place&#8221; with plenty of room for me to move around, sit, stand, ponder, and dance with my work. I am always grateful for the continuous opportunity and abundance that keeps me doing and sharing what I love to do.</p>

<p>This attic studio is just one of many &#8220;part-time&#8221; spaces that I use. It reflects my daily process of navigating this space, in its many instances of existence, to create large sculptures (which you can see in this image), smaller explorations, growing plants for installations, photography, and drawings. It is always in a constant state of change, construction, and deconstruction, which reflects my own process in some ways. Working in an attic space has taught me to learn from working in non-traditional spaces and arrangements and to be flexible with what I create and how it&#8217;s constructed. Believe me — you need to be 5 steps ahead of yourself in order to be able to get large pieces up and down such a narrow flight of stairs!</p>

<p>With a magnesium flash triggered by a tripwire, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Shiras_III" target="_blank">George Shiras</a> shot some of the world&#8217;s first nocturnal wildlife photographs. The shock of the bright light exploding in the night is reflected in the startled deer leaping in all directions of the black-and-white images, which illuminated a previously invisible part of the natural world. Shiras, who perfected his techniques from the 1880s until his death in 1942, is now considered among the first wildlife photographers, and a major influence on American conservation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/2365110916/hyperallergic-20" target="_blank"><em>George Shiras: In the Heart of the Dark Night</em></a> was recently published in French and English by <a href="http://exb.fr/en/catalogue/247-in-the-heart-of-the-dark-night.html" target="_blank">Éditions Xavier Barral</a> in conjunction with an exhibition <a href="http://www.chassenature.org/linterieur-de-la-nuit-george-shiras-du-15-septembre-2015-au-14-fevrier-2016/" target="_blank">at the Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature</a> in Paris. In an essay accompanying the monograph, author Jean-Christophe Bailly describes the photographs:</p>
<blockquote><p>They suddenly appear out of the enchanted depths to which they will return as soon as the disturbance of flash and camera has passed. In the meantime, however, the shot is there for us, namely that image of animals, isolated and transfixed against the dark night like creatures of flame or ghosts. And in that picture, that instant, all the life and intensity of what living can mean seems to have been pinned down.</p></blockquote>

<p>Born in Pennsylvania, Shiras was a hunter in his youth until he switched his gun for a camera <a href="http://www.chassenature.org/linterieur-de-la-nuit-george-shiras-du-15-septembre-2015-au-14-fevrier-2016/" target="_blank">in 1880</a>. Like <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/247340/jacob-riiss-photographic-battle-with-new-yorks-19th-century-slums/" target="_blank">Jacob Riis in New York</a>, who used his own version of the magnesium flash to photograph the city&#8217;s squalid tenements, photography was an advocacy tool for Shiras. Neither considered their photography an art, but saw it as a visual support for their respective causes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the poetic element that emanates from these pictures, their experimental and committed nature distinguished them from the images of certain 19th-century painters and photographers, with their portrayals of a nostalgic, idealized nature, unspoiled and authentic,&#8221; editor and curator Sonia Voss writes. &#8220;They bear the legacy of the confrontation between man and animal that determined their creation.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_270723" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/georgeshirascover.jpg"><img class="wp-image-270723" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/georgeshirascover.jpg" alt="Cover of 'George Shiras: In the Heart of the Dark Night' (click to enlarge)" width="320" height="405" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/georgeshirascover-142x180.jpg 142w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/georgeshirascover-768x973.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/georgeshirascover-808x1024.jpg 808w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/georgeshirascover.jpg 947w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cover of &#8216;George Shiras: In the Heart of the Dark Night&#8217; (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>Shiras was also a US Representative for Pennsylvania (1903–05), and as a politician helped secure land that became <a href="http://www.nps.gov/olym/index.htm" target="_blank">Olympic National Park</a> and <a href="http://www.nps.gov/PEFO/planyourvisit/index.htm" target="_blank">Petrified Forest National Park</a>, as well as an extension to Yellowstone National Park. He introduced legislation that evolved into the Migratory Bird Bill. But it was his 74 photographs published in a July 1906 issue of <em>National Geographic</em> that made the biggest impact, being the first wildlife photographs printed in a magazine that eventually became the genre&#8217;s leader.</p>
<p>Gil Grosvenor, then director of the National Geographic Society and its magazine, <a href="http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photographers/first-wildlife-photos.html" target="_blank">reportedly said</a> that &#8220;nobody had ever seen pictures like that of wild animals.&#8221; However, not everyone was enthused, and two members of their Board of Managers resigned, including geologist Alfred H. Brooks, who <a href="http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photographers/first-wildlife-photos.html" target="_blank">thought</a> the magazine was becoming just &#8220;a picture gallery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the 2,400 glass plates of wildlife in the US and Canada that Shiras <a href="http://proof.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/20/meet-grandfather-flash-the-pioneer-of-wildlife-photography/" target="_blank">donated</a> to the Society were scanned for the first time to illustrate <em>In the Heart of the Dark Night</em>. While the images feature their fair share of startled deer, the book also has more placid images captured through Shiras&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlighting" target="_blank">jacklighting</a> technique, in which he rode on a canoe with a bright light to catch the eyeshine of animals — a trick he adapted from the Ojibwe. A lynx watches pensively from the shore; a raccoon gnaws at some unseen feast; and a moose wades into the reeds, the water rippling around its huge form. The images record fleeting moments in a dark landscape, one that was better protected thanks to Shiras putting down his rifle and taking up &#8220;camera hunting&#8221; instead.</p>

<p>Since its discovery in 1994, the Chauvet-Pont d&#8217;Arc cave in southern France has been a rich site for researchers to study prehistoric art, featuring early paintings of both animals and humans on its walls. Now the ancient site — which in 2014 received UNESCO World Heritage Site status — may also present the oldest depiction of a volcanic eruption discovered yet, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146621" target="_blank">according</a> to a study recently published by a team of French scientists in the journal <em>PLoS One</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our work provides the first evidence of an intense volcanic activity between 40 and 30 ka in the Bas-Vivarais region,&#8221; researchers write in the study, &#8220;and it is very likely that humans living in the Ardèche river area witnessed one or several eruptions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Likely finger-painted with red and white pigments, the paintings resemble little fountains — &#8220;spray-shape signs,&#8221; as the team describes them. They appear on the walls of various galleries in the cave; one appears to emerge from the head of a Megaloceros, which was later drawn in charcoal and partially covers the abstract pattern. The researchers, comparing the age of the symbols with dates of local volcanic activity, believe the cave dwellers were responding to an eruption that occurred approximately 36,000 years ago. The closest volcano would have stood in the Bas-Vivarais region, a little over 20 miles northwest of the cave.</p>
<div id="attachment_270551" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270551" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/armenia.jpg" alt="Çatalhöyük mural painting in Turkey, considered the oldest depiction of a volcanic eruption, dated from the 8th/7th millennium BCE" width="640" height="310" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/armenia-291x141.jpg 291w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/armenia-768x372.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/armenia.jpg 771w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Çatalhöyük mural painting in Turkey, considered the oldest depiction of a volcanic eruption, dated from the 8th/7th millennium BCE</p></div>
<p>“There’s no way anybody could prove that it is a volcano that they depicted, but for us it’s the hypothesis which is the most probable,” Sebastien Nomade, who led the study, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/cave-of-forgotten-dreams-may-hold-earliest-painting-of-volcanic-eruption-1.19177" target="_blank">told</a> <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_270550" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/spray.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-270550"><img class="wp-image-270550" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/spray.jpg" alt="Petroglyphs depicting the Porak volcano eruption in the Syunik region of Armenia (click to enlarge)" width="320" height="271" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Petroglyphs depicting the Porak volcano eruption in the Syunik region of Armenia (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>If the scientists&#8217; claims are true, the paintings would predate the nearly 9,000-year-old Çatalhöyük mural in Turkey, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/01/09/260918293/there-she-blew-volcanic-evidence-of-the-worlds-first-map" target="_blank">previously identified</a> in the early 1960s by archaeologist James Mellaart as the earliest representation of such an eruption. Another known depiction is found in southern Armenia, where a group of six petrogylphs dating to the 5th millennium BCE show eruptions of the Porak volcano. The Chauvet image would also predate Pliny the Younger&#8217;s famous description of the 79 CE Vesuvias eruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they make a pretty good case that it’s potentially a depiction of the kind of volcano that one sees on the landscape,” as Michael Petraglia, a University of Oxford archaeologist (unaffiliated with the study) told <em>Nature. </em>&#8220;Maybe there’s more of this out there than we have realized.”</p>

<p>MEXICO CITY — Art school may be the closest thing to <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" target="_blank">Hogwarts</a> on this planet, where undergrads are desensitized to full-frontal nudity and cry in front of their classmates. Mexico City’s <a href="http://somamexico.org/" target="_blank">SOMA</a>, an unaccredited nonprofit program, offers an alternative to the traditional MFA and, unlike Hogwarts, promises no magic for dispatching life’s obstacles. In a show now on view at <a href="http://www.casamaauad.com/" target="_blank">Casa Maauad</a>, some of SOMA’s most recent graduates demonstrate formal sophistication and a multiplicity of interests, while still remaining cohesive as a group.</p>
<p>I’m often surprised by masters students from prestigious schools, who feel torn down by the institution and unsure of their creative choices. Academia, a necessarily and rigidly defined system, can be at odds with the nature of art, which necessarily denies definition. Unfortunately, our economic and cultural reality means many talented artists earn MFAs only to become bartenders or servers toling under a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/12/mfas-an-increasingly-popular-increasingly-bad-financial-decision/383706/" target="_blank">mountain of debt</a>. <em>El Aire Entre las Cosas </em> (or “The Air in Between”) makes a strong case for SOMA and other alternative programs’ relevance.</p>

<p>The history of Casa Maauad, a nonprofit artistic and curatorial residency program, plays an important role in the show. Legend has it that the 100-year-old colonial-style mansion was originally designed as a brothel, with a central room branching off into hidden corridors. The house is located in Mexico City’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/travel/colonia-san-rafael-in-mexico-city-is-on-the-upswing.html?_r=0" target="_blank">San Rafeal</a> neighborhood, an up-and-coming district of new galleries and studios.</p>
<p>Drama and theater play a central role in the exhibition, which reveals itself across many rooms and concealed spaces. The show at times feels like an obstacle course and a soundstage for a telenovela. The participating artists created work that sets the stage for introspection, intervention, and participation by the audience. From archeology to anthropology, each artist was very specific in his or her ideas and execution. As the title of the show suggests, the work focuses on negative spaces or things that are missing.</p>
<div id="attachment_270573" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270573" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/casa-maauad-mexico-city-05.jpg" alt="Marcela Rico, “The mystery explained” (2015)" width="640" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/casa-maauad-mexico-city-05-270x180.jpg 270w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/casa-maauad-mexico-city-05-768x512.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/casa-maauad-mexico-city-05-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/casa-maauad-mexico-city-05.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Marcela Rico, “The mystery explained” (2015)</p></div>
<p>The show begins with &#8220;The mystery explained&#8221; (2015), a video work by <a href="http://www.somamexico.org/es/programa-educativo/marcela-rico" target="_blank">Marcela Rico</a>. An empty stage in an empty auditorium is lit with lights that sweep around in a ballet of stage production and lighting cues. Special effects and backstage happenings become the show. A seemingly infinite combination of lights, screens, and other effects bring the empty auditorium to life. The video, which lasts about 10 minutes, is intimate, beautiful, and maintains the quality of a composition script or score even with the layers of spectacle and audience stripped away. Rico’s editing and videography make the stage itself a character in the drama for which it typically serves as a mere support.</p>
<p>Beyond Rico&#8217;s video, a hidden entrance leads viewers into an installation by <a href="http://gallery.kristinreger.com/" target="_blank">Kristin Reger</a>, which they enter by way of an elevated catwalk. Evocative of Casa Mauaad’s illicit past, the space is lit in red and its hidden entryway recalls a time of speakeasies and burlesque. Glitter, gold drapery, tequila, and mirrors dominate the installation. A luscious backdrop or set for an act that never took the stage echoes Rico&#8217;s video and creates open space for the audience to enter.</p>
<div id="attachment_270574" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270574" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/casa-maauad-mexico-city-06.jpg" alt="Kristin Reger, “Because the Night” (2015)" width="640" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/casa-maauad-mexico-city-06-270x180.jpg 270w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/casa-maauad-mexico-city-06-768x512.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/casa-maauad-mexico-city-06-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/casa-maauad-mexico-city-06.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kristin Reger, “Because the Night” (2015)</p></div>
<p>The exhibition’s central space features a community-sourced installation by <a href="http://www.somamexico.org/es/programa-educativo/fernanda-barreto" target="_blank">Fernanda Barreto</a>. &#8220;Neighborhood meeting&#8221; was created using materials brought in from the surrounding area. The work asks what the word “neighbor” means and at the same time alludes to issues of gentrification relevant to the area. Not long ago, San Rafael was primarily inhabited by working class families, a community that some feel is threatened by the impending redevelopment of the neighborhood, along with the influx of bars, stores, and restaurants. In this way, the work is self-critical and asks what artists’ roles are in the process of gentrification and development.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.somamexico.org/es/programa-educativo/ricardo-crdenas" target="_blank">Ricardo Cárdenas</a> and <a href="http://somamexico.org/en/programa-educativo/jael-orea" target="_blank">Jael Orea</a> both present projects that take a longer view of change and border on archeology. Cárdenas’ installation, like so many other works in <em>El Aire Entre las Cosas</em>, recalls a stage set, but also looks like a dig site where viewers are invited to sift through artifacts in the form of documents. Visitors are free to sift through piles of paper, which began as perfect stacks, but now fill the floor. “Roots or Rhizomes,” reads one document. Another asks, “Is the truth historical?” Orea’s work involves black market antiquities that the artist purchased — mostly small fragments of pre-Hispanic figures, including a clay arm and head, shown in the exhibition in the form of photographs. The work raises questions about authenticity, cultural appropriation, and ownership. Around the corner, Pedro Hernández installed a real-time projection of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popocat%C3%A9petl" target="_blank">Popocatepetl volcano</a> spewing smoke and gas. The projection screen is stretched across a doorway, creating a faux portal to the outside world. Popo, as locals call it, looms perilously over Mexico City, obscured by the hazy skyline. The installation brings the outside into the gallery, creating a cold digital version of engaging with nature.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://lauramezaorozco.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Laura Meza-Orozco</a> and <a href="http://somamexico.org/en/programa-educativo/isauro-huizar" target="_blank">Isauro Huizar</a>’s contributions stand apart for their formal minimalism. Meza-Orozco created a series of monochromatic paintings that portray the evolution of skin color in Mexico between 1827 and 2010, offering a sort of sweeping portrait of an ever more mulatto society. Huizar closes out the show by bringing viewers’ attention back to the space, stripping away layers of paint and gesso on an entire wall to excavate 100-year-old textures, revealing the topography of Casa Mauaad’s history. The building is personified in an accompanying text written by the artist, which tells the wall’s firsthand account of being revealed.</p>
<p>In <em>El Aire Entre las Cosas, </em>the SOMA grads allude to negative space as full of potential, rather than empty. The work focuses on foundations and contexts, without explicit and easily discovered objects or actors. The processes of taking away layers of concealment and revealing hidden subjects and images reference Casa Mauaad&#8217;s past. The exhibition parallel&#8217;s the program&#8217;s ambitions, as SOMA seeks to strip away layers of academia and institutionalization to foster a space for openness and education.</p>

<p>Forget James Bond — how about we get Idris Elba to be the next Batman? Or the next Superman or the next Flash?</p>
<p>Questions like these were in the air on January 16 as an estimated 5,000 comic book lovers — and their kids — squeezed into the 4th annual <a href="http://www.nypl.org/events/programs/2016/01/16/4th-annual-black-comic-book-festival" target="_blank">Black Comic Book Festival</a> at the Schomburg Center in Harlem.</p>
<div id="attachment_269770" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Blerds-in-the-process-of-Bleeking-out.png"><img class="wp-image-269770" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Blerds-in-the-process-of-Bleeking-out.png" alt="Blerds in the process of bleeking out (click to enlarge)" width="320" height="425" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blerds in the process of bleeking out (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>Although this festival is much smaller than the major ComiCons, it was filled to capacity all day long. There were more than 35 exhibitors and more than 75 artists and writers, and several excellent panels were held throughout the day on topics as diverse as the pros and cons of self-pubishing, terms like “blerd” (black nerd) and “bleek” (black geek), and how women fit into an industry that has historically objectified them. Everywhere you turned you would see kids posing for pictures with men dressed as Green Lantern, the Black Panther, and the most famous black vampire since Blackula – Blade.</p>
<p>Some notable artists present were DMC from Run DMC, a self-described comic nerd who — fun fact — sold part of his childhood comic book collection to buy his first turntables; Guy Sims, writer of the very popular series <a href="http://www.brothermancomics.com/" target="_blank"><em>BrotherMan</em></a>; and <a href="https://pariscullins.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Paris Cullins</a>, renowned artist and writer for Marvel and DC.</p>
<div id="attachment_269772" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-269772" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Paris-Cullins-draws-a-picture-for-Bryce-Josiah-Adetunji.png" alt="Paris Cullins draws a picture for Bryce &amp; Josiah Adetunji" width="640" height="592" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Paris-Cullins-draws-a-picture-for-Bryce-Josiah-Adetunji-195x180.png 195w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Paris-Cullins-draws-a-picture-for-Bryce-Josiah-Adetunji.png 573w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Paris Cullins draws a picture for Bryce &amp; Josiah Adetunji.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_269779" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-269779" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Woman-looking-at-some-original-art-for-sale.png" alt="Woman looking at original art for sale" width="640" height="507" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Woman-looking-at-some-original-art-for-sale-227x180.png 227w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Woman-looking-at-some-original-art-for-sale.png 734w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Woman looking at original art for sale</p></div>
<p>There were also many interesting independent artists with their wares on display, selling everything from t-shirts to buttons to posters. A standout was a poster made by (H)afrocentric of a woman climbing a flagpole in order to replace the confederate flag with a Jamaican one – she was drawn like a superhero, and she was sporting an resplendent afro. It was a smart way to reference Brittany &#8220;Bree&#8221; Newsome’s <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2015/7/3/this_flag_comes_down_today_bree" target="_blank">removal</a> of the flag at South Caroliina’s state capitol last summer.</p>
<div id="attachment_269776" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Regina-Sawyer-shows-off-her-own-production.png"><img class="wp-image-269776" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Regina-Sawyer-shows-off-her-own-production.png" alt="Regina Sawyer shows off her comic (click to enlarge)" width="320" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Regina-Sawyer-shows-off-her-own-production-135x180.png 135w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Regina-Sawyer-shows-off-her-own-production.png 603w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Regina Sawyer shows off her comic. (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>A gaggle of young girls drew me over to the Women in Comics (<a href="http://www.lockettdown.com/" target="_blank">WinC</a>) table, which also boasted a variety of posters, shirts, and comics. WinC was formed to bring attention to female writers, illustrators, and publishers — an important goal in a field long dominated by fanboys. Founder Regine Sawyer was talking to the girls, most of whom were wide-eyed, telling them about WinC’s work and its own upcoming <a href="http://womenincomicsnyccint.wix.com/womenincomicsnyc">comics convention</a> at the Bronx Library on March 19.</p>
<p>Near Sawyer I ran into Lion Forge Comics editor Adam Staffaroni. He was chatting with <a href="http://www.whittaylorcomics.com/comics.html" target="_blank">Whit Taylor</a> as she showed him copies of her series <em>Madtown High</em>. After she completed the series, which she both wrote and illustrated, she upped her game with a book called <em>GHOST</em>, which, she told us proudly, had sold out of its first printing. Whereas <em>Madtown High</em> is a stapled zine illustrated with line drawings, <em>GHOST</em> is a book in full color. It reminded me of the early work of Gabrielle Bell, who is now a regular on the comic book circuit. As with Bell, it’s always exciting to see an artist — in any medium — pushing her own boundaries.</p>
<div id="attachment_269775" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Whit-Taylor-with-her-Madtown-High-comics-.png"><img class="wp-image-269775" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Whit-Taylor-with-her-Madtown-High-comics-.png" alt="Whit Taylor with her Madtown High comics (click to enlarge)" width="320" height="428" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Whit Taylor with her &#8216;Madtown High&#8217; comics (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>We also discussed the way personal zines still have currency despite their lack of superheros. Staffaroni said, “People still like to see artists as suffering or starving, isolated and alone — they romanticize that.”</p>
<p>Later, well-known comic artist and filmmaker <a href="http://thedavidwalkersite.com/" target="_blank">David Walker</a> summed up an important thrust of the event for me. “You realize illiteracy for teenage boys is at an epidemic level?” he said. “Just look at <em>Twilight</em>. And you wonder why they don’t want to read!” But now, thanks to Walker and his ilk, people of color are being represented in comic books and movie adaptations more than ever. Young boys (and girls) of color now have heroes of their own who actually look like them! <em>That</em> will definitely keep them reading — and turn them into lifelong comics fans.</p>
<p><em>The 4th annual <a href="http://www.nypl.org/events/programs/2016/01/16/4th-annual-black-comic-book-festival" target="_blank">Black Comic Book Festival</a> took place at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture (515 Malcolm X Boulevard, Harlem, Manhattan) on January 16, 10am–7pm.</em></p>

<p>Learning diagnostic medicine is not just about recognizing symptoms of illness, but also involves interacting with the emotionally complex creature that is the human being. Brooklyn-based photographer <a href="http://www.corinnebotz.com/Corinne_May_Botz/Corinne_May_Botz.html" target="_blank">Corinne May Botz</a> spent three years documenting simulations in medical schools, where hired professionals portray various conditions of what are known as &#8220;standardized patients.&#8221; The resulting series, <em><a href="http://benrubigallery.com/exhibition/382/bedside-manner" target="_blank">Bedside Manner</a>, </em>is now on view at <a href="http://benrubigallery.com/" target="_blank">Benrubi Gallery</a> in Chelsea.</p>
<div id="attachment_269853" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bedsidemanner05.jpg"><img class="wp-image-269853" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bedsidemanner05.jpg" alt="Corinne May Botz" width="320" height="260" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bedsidemanner05-222x180.jpg 222w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bedsidemanner05-768x623.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bedsidemanner05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Corinne May Botz, &#8220;Life Support&#8221; from the series &#8216;Bedside Manner&#8217; (2013) (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a strong sense of voyeurism in the large-scale prints lining the gallery walls, many of them showing the &#8220;patient&#8221; through a two-way mirror or on a video screen, emphasizing that we&#8217;re witnessing a performance. Behind a curtain, you can watch a documentary Botz made with neurologist Alice Flaherty, who acts as both doctor and patient. In the photographs, we don&#8217;t know if the pose of a subject is part of &#8220;playing sick,&#8221; or a moment of stillness as she waits for a medical student to arrive. That uncanny perspective is something Botz previously examined in her <em><a href="http://benrubigallery.com/gallery/132/nutshell-studies-unexplained-death" target="_blank">The Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death</a> </em>(1999–2004), a series on incredibly detailed crime scene dioramas from the 1940s. In both projects, the division between the real and the simulated is constantly in flux.</p>
<p>While on their surface they show mimicry of illness, the <em>Bedside Manner</em> images are also studies in empathy. The medical students learn to sensitively approach a woman suffering from postpartum hemorrhage (represented by a strange prosthetic) and a couple visiting a loved one who is on life support (and who also happens to be a plastic mannequin). In one image, an ebola patient looks at a doctor in a hazmat suit, and in the most surreal photograph, a human hand gently touches a dummy&#8217;s plastic fingers. The viewer&#8217;s empathy is also tested, as we consider whether the pain in these faces is real, and how we measure the authenticity of suffering.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within certain chambers of poetry in the past year, a series of incidents, specifically involving white poets presenting work that has been called out for its callous racism, has led to a great deal of debate on the internet and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three of the most prominent incidents are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/190954/kenneth-goldsmith-remixes-michael-brown-autopsy-report-as-poetry/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenneth Goldsmith reading a re-organized autopsy report of the recently slain Michael Brown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a conference, a performance for which Goldsmith was paid.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/208995/why-a-white-poet-should-not-be-attempting-to-reclaim-the-n-word/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vanessa Place tweeting the unedited text of Margaret Mitchell’s novel </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone With the Wind</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 140 characters at a time, and attaching the image of actress Hattie McDaniel to her profile while doing so (this was actually a long-term project started in 2009 that became the subject of debate only last year).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/books/a-white-poet-borrows-a-chinese-name-and-sets-off-fireworks.html?_r=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Derrick Hudson adopting the pseudonym “Yi-Fen Chou,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implying that his work was that of a Chinese woman in an attempt to manipulate the editors of the journals he sought to be published in, and last year being selected for inclusion in the 2015 edition of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best American Poetry</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are hardly the only such incidents of 2015, but they are the ones that have been recently offered up as telling symptoms of a larger problem. The whiteness of these poets is not the only point of the debates, it’s also the fact that each of them attained or has status within the poetry community, whether it be through publication in a major anthology, teaching and speaking it at<strong> </strong>gigs, or, earning income from poetry-related events and activities. In other words, this is about race, but also status, and the control and awarding of resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September of last year, not long after the story of Hudson’s deception broke, the poets Juliana Spahr and Stephanie Young, both white women who have teaching jobs in poetry at Mills College, published a lengthy essay in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles Review of Books</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> titled, “</span><a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/the-program-era-and-the-mainly-white-room" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Program Era and the Mainly White Room</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” It was clearly intended to garner further conversation within the poetry world around race, status, and resources. The essay mentions the above events, but leaps off primarily from the fact that the vast majority of physical spaces that they and their colleagues visit to hear and share work are peopled<strong> </strong>largely by white poets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spahr and Young focus the bulk of their analysis on higher education, specifically MFAs and PhDs in creative writing. Crunching a couple decades worth of data, they looked for clues as to why, even as the proportion of women and writers of color enrolled in these programs has increased with time, the white room persists. Two of their findings are worth repeating:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In separating out the schools that fully fund MFA students versus those where students must pay or go into to debt to attend, the fully funded programs were noticeably whiter and more male. “In 2013, 21 percent of graduates from debt generator schools identified as women and other than white. At the fully funded programs, that number was only 10 percent.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this: “Worth noticing here is how intensely the MFA system resembles a Ponzi scheme.” See the chart below mapping the increase in MFAs being awarded and the number of tenure track jobs available to MFA grads:</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a brief counterpoint to the mainly white room of creative writing graduate degrees, Spahr and Young offer a cursory look at racially and ethnically specific arts organizations tied to radical political movements in the US during the 1960s and &#8217;70s, such as the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Arts_Movement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Arts Repertory Theatre</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://elteatrocampesino.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Teatro Campesino</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_Writers_Workshop" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watts Writers Workshop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the </span><a href="http://www.nuyorican.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuyorican Poets Café</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But they cut off that history rather abruptly by asserting that those movements “got killed in multiple ways” and don’t meaningfully acknowledge the continued existence of some of these spaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end the essay, they leave off with: “For us, for now, the best we can do is work to understand so that, when we create alternatives to the program, they do not amplify its hierarchies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, now it’s 2016. Certainly the passing of another solstice does not a new landscape make. But when I heard that </span><a href="http://www.uglyducklingpresse.org/catalog/browse/item/?pubID=240" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone White</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, program director at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span> <a href="http://www.poetryproject.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poetry Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here in New York, was organizing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/537125723124098/" target="_blank">a live event</a> that would take up Spahr and Young’s essay, I was curious to attend because I feel connected to that space and some of the people who are part of its community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White invited a number of writers to respond to the essay in writing, including </span><a href="https://directory.calarts.edu/directory/tisa-bryant" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tisa Bryant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://directory.calarts.edu/directory/jen-hofer" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jen Hofer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://lmcc.net/person/krystal-languell/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krystal Languell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.pratt.edu/faculty_and_staff/bio/?id=rlevitsk" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Levitsky</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Their contributions were read aloud at the beginning of the event. Following that, there were additional written and unwritten responses from those present in front of the room: </span><a href="http://mahoganybrowne.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahogany L. Browne</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.cherylclarkepoet.com/about/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheryl Clarke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/about/directory/photo/889187964" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ariel Goldberg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="http://www.pw.org/content/%5Btitle%5D_4402" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christopher Stackhouse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with Simone White participating as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the writers and speakers raised two points of contention with Spahr and Young’s overall reasoning: 1) their implication that the white room is the only room, and 2) their implication that everybody wants to be in the white room. While Spahr and Young do briefly note in a couple of spots that some people may simply not want to participate in the white room, they really don’t examine why that’s the case, nor do they do more than briefly mention a couple of spaces they know of in the Bay Area that are not mainly white. In other words, they posit a white room and focus their inquiry almost entirely on the white room, without much looking outward, or in from the outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But beyond the arguments with Spahr and Young’s ideas and methodology, what was most interesting to me about the conversation at the Poetry Project </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were the moments when those invited to contribute and speak made concrete suggestions about how to counteract or simply abstain from the white room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is my attempt to briefly lay out what I heard:</span></p>
<h2>Structural Oppression</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In order to cross the threshold and enjoy whatever intellectual communion on offer, the POC poet-writer has to wrangle with discomfort, alienation, and the bewildering ambiance of elitism, exoticism, and exceptionalism, among many other complexities that at once flatter one’s ego and siphon from one’s spirit, in exchange for education, publication, employment.” —Tisa Bryant, in written contribution to the event </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structural oppression is Spahr and Young’s jumping-off point, but their analysis, while useful as regards certain aspects of higher education, remains a bit myopic for choosing only to focus there. What structural oppression looks like from a wide-angle lens starts from the ground up, and early on in life.<strong> </strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are dramatically different levels of access to arts education from the very beginning of childhood through adulthood. Moreover, European cultures and those of European descent remain the focus within the vast majority of US arts textbooks, museums, government buildings, cultural centers, etc. Meaning that the stories people are taught from a young age center on white people the vast majority of the time. And, when it comes to the idea of pursuing a life as an artist, economics are a factor at every turn. As Christopher Stackhouse noted: “You have to be able to afford to sit and write a poem.” All of which is to say, myriad structural oppressions are at play long before graduate school would even be an idea in someone’s head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, Stackhouse seemed to offer a point of agreement with one piece of Spahr and Young’s methodology: statistics. “No one wants to look at numbers because poets are above all that … that’s a crock of shit,” he offered. The reality is that while statistics and the collecting of data can be incredibly dubious, there has been power and wide-scale consciousness-raising in the past few years with the publication and widespread sharing of some the more straightforward counting exercises: </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">income inequality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.vidaweb.org/category/the-count/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the VIDA count</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="http://www.guerrillagirls.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guerilla Girls decades-long arts accounting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/117065/tallying-art-world-inequality-one-gallery-at-a-time/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micol Hebron’s Gallery Tally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/93821/the-depressing-stats-of-the-2014-whitney-biennial/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim Drew’s one-tweet count at the Whitney Biennial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to name just a few.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more recently, when it comes to the question of the white room in New York City, one of the first projects that Arts Commissioner Tom Finkelpearl announced after his appointment was a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/arts/new-york-city-plans-to-study-the-diversity-of-its-cultural-groups.html?_r=0" target="_blank">simple count</a> of the race and gender in<strong> </strong>the leadership of arts institutions around the city. While he&#8217;s made it clear that the only action he&#8217;s going to take is to do the count, and that there are no current plans in place to institute policies based on the results, my sense is that the act of counting alone has the potential to drive some organizations to do better at mirroring the population of the city.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_270266" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_4605.jpg"><img class="wp-image-270266" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_4605.jpg" alt="IMG_4605" width="320" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_4605-135x180.jpg 135w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_4605-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_4605.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Simone White at the Poetry Project (photo by the author for Hyperallergic) (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>Counts can prove particularly useful when focused on leadership because one of the most straightforward ways to begin to tackle structural oppression when it comes to race is to increase the diversity of those in power, i.e to better spread the control of resources. A shift in the race of leadership is not sufficient to end oppression, but it is necessary.</p>
<h2>Pretending Aesthetics Are Benign</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stackhouse also offered a number of insights and provocations on aesthetics, speaking about his own ambivalence around becoming a “well-trained poet,” and about “acculturation and training your vocabulary.” In response to his comments, I couldn&#8217;t help thinking about areas of the arts that attach terms like “avant-garde” or “experimental” to themselves — about how so many young writers aspire to be &#8220;avant-garde&#8221; by trying to mirror the behaviors and artistic mannerisms of past, often European, artists. And in arts programs from grade school to grad school, students are actively encouraged to look to &#8220;masters&#8221; of European art as the models to train themselves to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, we no longer live in a world where a single dominant art movement is there to ride ahead of or overturn — there are hundreds, if not thousands, of simultaneous styles and progressions within our myriad culture. So what “avant-garde” or “experimental” means to me, when I hear it today, specifically within institutional settings (i.e. from people who have some measure of access to institutional arts in the US), is precisely the opposite of the words’ meanings — the people claiming those titles wish to align themselves with an imaginary dominant art movement. Put another way, it’s an assimilationist desire that many white people themselves are driven by and promote, when there is little left in the art world to assimilate to other than lauding career and money, or “achievement” as it&#8217;s more typically described.</span></p>
<p>As a white woman in the arts, I can attest to having spent time trying to assimilate to this fuzzy fever dream and it’s only in the past few years — as conversations around race, labor, gender, privilege, cultural self-determination, etc., have picked up new steam — that I’ve really begun to understand how much past models of success in the arts are influencing so many artists, inclusive of all races.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the most pernicious lie beneath “avant-garde” or “experimental” is that some people falsely claim that this designation somehow absolves them of the political context of their work. This is ultimately the kind of maneuver attempted by Kenneth Goldsmith when <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kenneth.goldsmith.739/posts/354492771403205">defending his reading</a>: &#8220;I always massage dry texts to transform them into literature, for that it [sic] what they are when I read them.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As if somehow, the work is an entity separate and divorced from any context other than art, as if art itself were a non-political context. This could not be a more flagrant delusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about all this at the event, it seemed to me that there is no simple way out of this rabbit hole of aspirational<strong> </strong>assimilation — because what are you, what is culture, if so much of artistic production has been driving at assimilation for generations? Trying to find a way out of assimilation, do you look for specificity? L</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ocating an individual’s cultural specificity or claim to a culture is far more complex than looking at their race, class, or genetic material, particularly in the US, with its history of racial genocides, colonialism, mass immigration, and opportunism and exploitation, all of which dramatically alter and generate cultures over time. And what are the implications of specificity beyond race? Today it&#8217;s primarily artists of color who are asked, “where are you from?” every time their work is evaluated, whereas white artists are given the assumptive leeway to pursue any path they please. Stackhouse seemed to echo this frustration when he said: &#8220;We have to make rooms for individuals.&#8221;</span></p>

<h2>All the Other Rooms</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maybe this place set terms that we don’t want.” —Simone White</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wasn’t sure I wanted to break into those spaces in that way.” —Mahogany Brown</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why would anyone subject to racism want to keep going to a relentlessly racist space? This question was posed in a variety of ways throughout the night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People have been walking away from and refusing the white room, the male room, the straight room, the able-bodied room, all the rooms, for a long time. Alternative spaces and radical political movements did not get “killed” in this country. Narratives of failure around radical politics often look at too short a time span, too little of a sweep of history. Tactics can succeed or fail, individuals have most certainly been killed, groupings dispersed or dismantled, conditions altered, opportunities squashed, but that does not equal an erasure or a negation of lasting impact — short-lived successes can serve as long-term inspirations and drivers, as I learned from historian and curator Yasmin Ramírez in her work highlighting the lasting impact of <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/62274/recovering-the-history-of-the-puerto-rican-art-workers-coalition/">Puerto Rican members of the Art Workers Coalition</a> on the arts landscape of New York City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve noticed that a number of artists I’ve spoken to of late are strategic about the spaces they choose to step in and out of. Beneath this is a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deep questioning of who they share their energy with, which offers the artists some measure of control over when and how they will engage with others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, the question of the mainly white room seems to be most deeply about the white presumption to have access to every room and to every ear within that room. The culture defines that as the American birthright — you can do anything and go anywhere you please — but reserves access to that mythical birthright to only a few.</span></p>
<h2>The Role of Event Organizers</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Will there be enough time when there is never enough time? Will there be wine?” —Cheryl Clarke, at the Poetry Project</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a much more basic, pragmatic level, Simone White and Mahogany Brown noted that the question of who is present within a given room at a given time, has a great deal to do with the conditions of their life, their work, their families, their location, transport, etc. Can you show up? Do you have to be at work instead? Does it cost money? How much? Will there be child care or do you need to find or hire someone? Will there by food, water, bathrooms? Is the space accessible? Will there be enough space? What kinds of people have attended in the past? How were you treated by them in the past? How much energy do you have? Are you well enough?</span></p>
<p>A simple thing for event organizers to do would be to ask those questions and think about different people’s experiences of and in their space.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As for events, there are too many and the purpose of an evening is seldom clear. Some hosts seem to do the hosting in order to be thanked,” Krsytal Languell noted in her written contribution. Her</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> point seems mostly intended for white artists and white-led institutions organizing events, whose audiences consistently end up being primarily white. How about sharing your space, letting other people make use of it on their own terms? How about literally doing less to make room for others — to share the resources you have, or open up the possibility that the resources you are using could be put to use elsewhere? How about slowing down a bit? Don’t grasp so tightly.</span></p>
<p>And of course, there is the topic of discomfort, specifically the need for white people to accept that they will feel uncomfortable during conversations around race and in spaces that are not majority white. The need for white people to sit quietly with that discomfort has been discussed exhaustively elsewhere, but Stackhouse summarized it eloquently at the event:  “Are you willing to be ignorant &#8230; and to do so when it offers you no immediate pleasure?”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly this is not a complete list of everything that could be said on the question of race in arts spaces, but this is some of what I heard from those present and some of what it gave rise to. From what I heard, there are opportunities for change — places to start anyhow, located not in some amorphous and overarching world of the “arts,” but in individual people and specific spaces. </span></p>
<p><em>The live event &#8220;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/537125723124098/" target="_blank">White Room</a>&#8221; took place at the Poetry Project (131 E 10th Street, East Village, Manhattan) on January 6. </em></p>

<p>This week, artists &amp; empire, the first flower in space, Hollywood&#8217;s white problem, art in museum storage, MLK in Brooklyn, and more.</p>
<p><img src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/H-12.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> The most <a href="http://time.com/2015-most-popular-us-landmarks-instagram/" target="_blank">Instagrammed place in Arkansas</a> is the Crystal Bridges Museum.</p>
<p><img src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/H-12.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n02/inigo-thomas/at-tate-britain" target="_blank">Inigo Thomas reviews the <em>Artist &amp; Empire</em></a> exhibition at Tate Britain:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘Portraiture is always independent of Art and has little or nothing to do with it,’ the painter Benjamin Haydon wrote in the 1820s. ‘It is one of the staple manufactures of the empire. Wherever the British settle, wherever they colonise, they carry and will ever carry on trial by jury, horse racing and portrait painting.’ Portraiture isn’t really independent of art, but as Caroline Corbeau-Parsons explains in the catalogue to the <em>Artist and Empire</em> exhibition at Tate Britain (until 10 April), portraiture in India wasn’t simply painting; it was part of a rite introduced by Warren Hastings to reduce corruption within the East India Company. Instead of accepting ornate gifts from Indian potentates, officials were to be given pictures of those they wished to influence or rule over.</p>
<p>So painters like Frederick had an imperial calling, just as religious men, like his brother Charles, had. Or at least an opportunity: the problem faced by portrait painters in India was that their sitters didn’t always pay since they got nothing in return. That presumably was the point: the unreciprocated act of giving was a blunt reminder of the power of those unto whom gifts are given, but the people most likely to lose out were the artists themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/H-12.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> British actress Charlotte Rampling says the Oscars diversity row is &#8220;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/22/oscars-2016-charlotte-rampling-diversity-row-racist-to-white-people" target="_blank">racist to white people</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p>“One can never really know, but perhaps the black actors did not deserve to make the final list,” added Rampling. Asked if the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should introduce quotas, a proposal which no current advocate of increased diversity has mooted, she responded: “Why classify people? These days everyone is more or less accepted &#8230; People will always say: ‘Him, he’s less handsome’; ‘Him, he’s too black’; ‘He is too white’ &#8230; someone will always be saying ‘You are too’ [this or that] &#8230; But do we have to take from this that there should be lots of minorities everywhere?”</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/H-12.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> Will the <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/sleep-tech-will-widen-the-gap-between-the-rich-and-the-poor" target="_blank">emerging &#8220;sleep tech&#8221; exasperate the division between rich and poor</a>? Natalie O&#8217;Neill writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some experts believe that sleep reduction gadgets will intensify the planet’s income inequality problem, because only wealthy people will be able to afford them and can spend those extra waking hours working, making the rich even richer.</p>
<p>… Like computers, early models of these sleep innovations will likely cost tens of thousands of dollars, offering a biological advantage to those who are already economically advantaged, Rinesi said. That will likely trigger outrage and protest, he predicted. “The social and economic impact is going to be huge. It&#8217;s going to create a lot of resentment and envy. We are not used to wealthy people having a completely different biological experience of being alive.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/H-12.png" alt="" width="12" height="12" /> Talia Kosh lists the <a href="http://ht.ly/XpTpw" target="_blank">most interesting “appropriation” cases</a> to watch in 2016, including a case that involves Google Books:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>4. Google Books Is A Great Way to Discover Books-except for all those missing pages.</strong></p>
<p>In the case, Authors Guild v. Google Books, Inc. the Authors Guild has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a federal appeals court’s rulings on transformative use, according to a petition for review filed Dec. 31. The future of fair use could hinge on this case.</p>
<p>The Authors Guild has been fighting Google in court since 2005 over its mass digitization of library collections in order to create a database for full-text searching. The Authors Guild rightfully argues that there is a circuit split regarding fair use and specifically the “transformative use” factor. It’s often in times of circuit splits that the Supreme Court will take up a case.</p>
<p>Some of the questions presented in the Guild’s petition are:</p>
<p>Whether, in order to be “transformative” under the fair use exception to copyright, the use of the copyrighted work must produce “new expression, meaning, or message,” as this Court stated in Campbell and as the Third, Sixth, and Eleventh circuits have held, or whether the verbatim copying of works for a different, non-expressive purpose can be a transformative fair use, as the Second, Fourth, and Ninth circuits have held; and</p>
<p>Whether the Second Circuit has erred in making “transformative purpose” a decisive factor, replacing the statutory four-factor test, as the Seventh Circuit has charged.</p>
<p>With a split in the circuits, the Supreme Court is the one in the hot seat.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A friend is a person with whom I may be sincere. Before him I may think aloud.

<p>Marsden Hartley represents a rather contradictory figure in American art and literature. Both poet and painter — he wrote poetry during the mornings throughout most of his life and painted in the afternoons — he survived through the latter, but actively sought out literary attention and wrote about literature as a “business.” As an visual artist Hartley was at first an experimental abstractionist, particularly in his so-called <em>German Paintings</em> of 1913–15, but later became a landscape artist and faux naïve realist in paintings such as &#8220;Fisherman’s Last Supper—Nova Scotia&#8221; (1940–41) and &#8220;Christ Held by Half-Naked Men&#8221; (1940).</p>

<p>Although in his youth he was known as one of the staunchest of the Greenwich Village bohemians, befriending a wide range of artists from Alfred Kreymborg, Djuna Barnes (who wrote a couple of articles about Hartley), Hart Crane, Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams, and Gertrude Stein, he spent most of his years in his native Maine, far away from city life. At times both his art and poetry could be radically experimental, but both also display a great deal of romantic-inspired mysticism and Christian faith.</p>
<p>As a gay male he was wary of social norms, while at the same time being attracted to militarism and even toying with some aspects of fascism. As a poet, despite his call for what he described as abandonment of “Swinburnian encrustations,” at times his writing verges on the verbose narrative stylings of the <em>fin de siècle</em> writers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Had gone to watch the pale blue ivy climb above steel graves<br />
of those who perished for the then so unrestricted huge idea—<br />
And THERE—the master of the house was seen—ALONE—<br />
making notes, with whispers on the side, of all the spoons his far<br />
respected guests with gentleness had lifted in their moments<br />
of ineffable simplicity, with jasmine hands to keep swift hounds<br />
from tracking royal bijoux to those shadows where deep pansies<br />
take another purple for their thought.</p>
<p>(“This lady rides a languid dromedary toward her dear-God,” 1923)</p></blockquote>
<p>The same year, however, Hartley created one of his most adventurous works, “Diabolo,” wherein the great Mexican volcanos comically interact with other volcanos of the world:</p>
<blockquote><p>Madame POPOcataPETL<br />
<span style="padding-left: 130px;">will pour tea   this aft –</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 50px;">from her own hospitable</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 210px;">fujiyama tooth –</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 50px;">ring around a rosy</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 70px;">on a craters lip –</span></p>
<p>POPOcataPETL is pouring –<br />
<span style="padding-left: 50px;">with lava syrup in it –</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 100px;">to sweeten it –</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 150px;">dynastic tea –</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 250px;">INFORMALLY –</span></p>
<p>We’ve been lying, climbing, juggling, throwing the javelin,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 40px;">bending, twisting, receding–</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 110px;">GRINNING moist grin s–</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 50px;">In an African apricot jungle–</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 80px;">While the white epidermis of</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 230px;">POPOcataPETL</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 150px;">Melts with livid afternoon fervor</span><br />

<span style="padding-left: 100px;">Cousin marmo—cousin goril –</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 170px;">Cousin ouran-outan –</span></p></blockquote>
<p>In a work such as “From a Paris Window–High&#8221; (first published in 1931), using simple language to speak of the silent scene he is witnessing below, Hartley sounds a great deal like his friend Williams:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this city<br />
of the generous,<br />
all are chivalrous.<br />
It is a scene<br />
where all are kind<br />
unless the wind<br />
be unkind<br />
in blowing chivalrous release<br />
over the unsuspecting mind.<br />
It is a country<br />
where the lip reveals<br />
no bitterness<br />
no irrelevant distress<br />
unless<br />
to be so secular<br />
instills a sharp remorse;<br />
it is a place<br />
where no one ever sees<br />
a face,<br />
and yet strange bodies<br />
meet<br />
and speak an alien<br />
sanskrit<br />
in which specific comprehension<br />
eternally resides,<br />
and no grammatical despairs<br />
are theirs.<br />
Sunday is the day<br />
when motley<br />
sways<br />
their way,<br />
who come to speak a word<br />
that never shall be heard<br />
unless<br />
it be, that silence<br />
covers all necessity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet throughout his long career as a poet, Hartley continued to use end, internal, and slant rhyme, to employ some regular rhythms, and to imbue his writing with aphoristic and even moralistic intent:</p>
<blockquote><p>The eagle wants no friends,<br />
employs his thoughts to other ends–<br />
he has his circles to inscribe<br />
twelve thousand feet from where<br />
the fishes comb the sea,<br />
he finds his solace in unscathed<br />
immensity,<br />
where eagles think, there is no need<br />
of being lonesome–<br />
In isolation<br />
is a deep revealing sense<br />
of home.</p>
<p>(written 1923-1929)</p></blockquote>
<p>At other times, as in his <em>City Scenes</em> sequence of poems from 1930-35, he appears to be interested more in a kind of “Ash Can School” kind of verism:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before the greenish door she stood,<br />
wild with insidious motherhood.<br />
Her eyes and breasts were singularly small,<br />
the rest of her was monumental.<br />
“I cannot come on Friday sir – I’m jew,<br />
will Sunday do!”<br />
There was a beastlike strength in what she said,<br />
the temple in her soul was hallowed<br />
with an ancient, patriarchal pride;</p></blockquote>
<p>Hartley often argued that his poetry did not refer to and should generally not be published in conjunction with his art, but he clearly occasionally based poems on his artworks and created artworks that came from poetic efforts, as in “Fishermen’s Last Supper” of the 1940s:</p>
<blockquote><p>For wine, they drank the ocean<br />
for bread, they ate their own despairs,<br />
counsel from the moon was theirs<br />
for the foolish contention.</p>
<p>Murder is not a pretty thing<br />
yet seas do raucous everything<br />
to make it pretty –<br />
for the foolish or the brave,<br />
a way seas have.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-269724" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/51nlNp2f9pL._SX313_BO1204203200_.jpg" alt="51nlNp2f9pL._SX313_BO1,204,203,200_" width="320" height="507" />Hartley’s poetry is varied stylistically and functions in so many different ways that I might almost be tempted to simply describe him as an occasional poet if one didn’t know how serious he was about his craft. As he writes in his essay, “The Business of Poetry,” “Poets must, it seems to me, learn how to use a great many words before they can know how to use a few skillfully. Journalistic verbiage is not fluency.” Soon after, he adds: “Poets cannot, as aspiring poets, depend, it seems to me, ever upon the natural ‘flow’ that exists in themselves. Poets have to work to do for the precision of simplicity, and for the gift of volume in simplicity.”</p>
<p>Still, even his more experimental efforts, he seldom achieves those goals. And yet in several of his later poems, Hartley accomplishes something close to the “machine of words” for which Williams argued. In “The Very Languor” of his unpublished “Miscellaneous Late Poems,” a few simple images, not unlike Williams’ chicken and wheelbarrow, evoke a kind of terror of space and an oppressive lack of energy:</p>
<blockquote><p>The very languor of the morning<br />
showing August is preparing<br />
for death because now sleeping.<br />
The crowing of the bantam–<br />
the red cheek of a single dahlia<br />
the fluttering of the wash on the line<br />
against the vastness of the<br />
horizontal of the sea –<br />
how terrifying at times a flat<br />
line can be –<br />
or the crowing of a bantam<br />
with a red cheek of a dahlia.<br />
The very languor of the morning<br />
is also – so.</p></blockquote>
<p>The last line with its so easy repetition not only reiterates the horizontality of the poet’s vision but the temporary lack of imagination he feels in the face of the real world around him while implying the notion of a “so-so” universe.</p>
<p>In many of Hartley’s poems, indeed, there is a strong sense of isolation, a being apart and away from other human beings, whether it be simply an issue of distance and space as in the poem from a high Paris window, or a more distinct sense of separation from others through religion and social position as in the window washer’s poem (despite his gentle declarations in this work, Hartley has often been described as a strong anti-Semite). Hartley, it is apparent, lost his deepest love, the German soldier Carl von Freyburg, early in his life when von Freyburg died in World War I; and although it is clear Hartley had many dear friends to which he dedicated many of his poems, as a gay man living down east, he must have suffered, at times, great loneliness, as becomes apparent in his short poem “There Are No Rocks and Trees,” where he notes, “There are no rocks and trees that take / the place of people / the people that are rich and round and large / strong with a nation’s agitation / deep with a lovingness profound –.”</p>
<p>And yet, particularly in his later poems, people seem to have almost disappeared or, against rugged cliffs and waves, are represented as puny things. It often seems in Hartley’s meditative works that the poem is always somewhat outside the action, very much as he describes one of his painter heroes, Albert Pinkham Ryder:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am speaking of Albert Ryder moonlightist<br />
as I knew him –<br />
“I asked him to Christmas dinner,” the lady<br />
said to me, who had a long time known him,<br />
“he said he would come, we waited two hours<br />
for him–the party eager to see him–he did<br />
not come”<br />
Next time she saw him – “O we were so<br />
disappointed you did not come”–<br />
“I was there,” said Ryder, “I looked through the<br />
window – saw the lovely lights – it was very beautiful.”</p>
<p>(unpublished)</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, one might almost describe Hartley’s poetry as somewhat voyeuristic, the work of a man who admits “I was an old man / at twenty-two” (“Surprise Package”), who goes about the countryside peering at the world about. This is nowhere more apparent than in his Whitman-esque vision of a father and his two young daughters taking a naked swim in a country “fresh water pond”:</p>
<blockquote><p>The man’s back was turned south, and he was very like a<br />
certain David, wide shouldered, small waist, round buttocks,<br />
iron legs, all muscle and sinews, and the worked look of<br />
his skin told him to be in his first forties<br />
………<br />
Man faced about breast facing south, and he magnificent,<br />
with smooth dark hair, coming to a point on a low fore-<br />
head, a firm mouth, the upper lip a little short, showing<br />
milkwhite teeth, and the eyes a deepest dark.<br />
His powerful manhood spoke above all whispers over him,<br />
hands and face bronzed with burning of the sun, the legs<br />
eggwhite.<br />
He went over to the bushes to undress and redress,</p>
<p>(published in <em>Selected Poems</em>, 1945)</p></blockquote>
<p>Both Hartley’s poetry and his paintings, <em>do</em>, after all, actually represent a kind of outsider art. As skilled and trained as he was in both endeavors, his vision came perhaps from someone outside looking in, from a personal vision forever separated from the worlds he was observing, whether it be the excitement of Berlin in the early 20th century, the originality he observed in the designs of Native Americans, the simple beauty of the small villages of Provençal, the wondrous mountains of Mexico and, later, the New Mexico vistas, or even the familiarity of the place where he had originally grown up.</p>
<p>The contradictoriness of his achievements, in fact, may emanate from this propensity to observe the world around him and try to make it his own. Unlike so many artists, who, after some years of experiment, develop their style to repeat it again and again, Hartley seems to have been always on the lookout for new possibilities, for a way to find his way into the various societies in which he temporarily lived. Perhaps it was only in the Maine landscape that he could truly identify himself. But we are richer for the fact that he explored so many other ways of seeing and speaking.</p>

<p>As Robert Creeley once said: “You can’t derail a train by standing directly in front of it, or, not quite. But, a tiny piece of steel, properly placed &#8230; ” The piece of steel in this case is the work of Allison Miller, an abstract painter who began showing her paintings in Los Angeles in 2006, a decade ago. She had first exhibition in New York City in 2012, followed by another the following year. <em><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fcf43fe4b0560c84dcc965/t/569e8a19a128e6f9904a727b/1453230617972/MILLER_12-15.pdf">ALLISON MILLER: Speeds</a></em> at Susan Inglett, the venue of all her shows, is now her third solo in New York (December 10, 2015–January 30, 2016). I reviewed the first two exhibitions and, after seeing her current one, feel compelled to do so again.</p>
<p>If you are wondering about the train and who is on it, it is that massive shadow that has been circling a cultural landscape marked by pastiche, citation, just plain copying, or the semblance of being provisional. It is full of passengers who are trying to dream up the next gimmick, since using a fire extinguisher as a “brush,” incorporating chewed gum as a medium, or laying work on the floor so that viewers can walk on it, have already been taken. These days, in order to become an attention-grabber, you have to convert the studio into a fashionable hybrid of Smart Ass Pranks and Romper Room.</p>
<div id="attachment_270081" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ALLISON-MILLER-Installation-View-2015-Susan-Inglett-Gallery-NYC..jpg"><img class="wp-image-270081" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ALLISON-MILLER-Installation-View-2015-Susan-Inglett-Gallery-NYC..jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ALLISON-MILLER-Installation-View-2015-Susan-Inglett-Gallery-NYC.-270x180.jpg 270w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ALLISON-MILLER-Installation-View-2015-Susan-Inglett-Gallery-NYC.-768x512.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ALLISON-MILLER-Installation-View-2015-Susan-Inglett-Gallery-NYC.-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ALLISON-MILLER-Installation-View-2015-Susan-Inglett-Gallery-NYC..jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Installation view of &#8216;ALLISON MILLER: Speeds&#8217; (2015) at Susan Inglett Gallery, New York City (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>Miller isn’t another hip passenger trying to find a niche in this strip-mined terrain. Nor — to her further credit — has she aligned herself with the “sincere” side of the tracks. You know, the ones standing in front of the train and gesticulating wildly, claiming to be the true heirs of Albert Pinkham Ryder, Arthur Dove, Frank Kline or (insert name of “outsider” artist here). Moreover, Miller is not trying to make aesthetically correct, postmodern abstractions that take their cues from Pop Art or jam together different historical styles together for a pleasing visual potpourri.</p>
<p>This is what got my attention when I first saw her work:</p>
<blockquote><p>She refuses to take the shortest route, physically and aesthetically as well, having rejected developing a recognizable style, sign or logo. She doesn’t advertise who she is, or where she is going, nor does she reach for a fashionable product, such as airless hard-edged abstraction or provisional painting. She isn’t trying to fit into any of the currently hip narratives, whether taught in art schools or regurgitated in art magazines. Even in this day and age of anything goes, that is quietly heretical act.</p></blockquote>
<p>The paintings and works on paper in her current show are unexpected, confounding, and witty. The range of allusions is wide and never overstated.</p>

<p>In the nearly square painting “Flush Arch” (2015), Miller uses oil paint, oil stick, acrylic, and pencil to evoke a piece of raw canvas affixed to a studio wall. I only came to this reading of the painting after I focused on the three turquoise bands, which extend from the painting’s ground to the seemingly “raw canvas.” The vertical bands on either side of the “raw canvas” evoked the bare areas left after strips of masking tape covered with paint have been pulled up. Miller makes a series of colored lines in these bare bands, which confounds our ability to place them: are they in front, behind or beside the plane of surrounding them? Elsewhere, Miller uses masking tape to puncture a layer of paint she has put down, which is different than how it has historically been used in hard-edge abstraction.</p>
<p>Miller’s process isn’t to cover the canvas with paint so much as to cover and uncover it, to interrupt, upend or subvert an expectation. For her, a canvas isn’t a surface to which another uniform surface is applied, but a kind of diary where things are added, covered over, uncovered — a combination of construction and archaeology. To assemble her paintings, she has transformed aspects of trompe l’oeil, hard-edged abstraction (the use of masking tape), patterning and repetition, transparency and layering, as ways of assembling her paintings. She also seems to have gotten something from the French <em>affichiste</em> artist Jacques Villeglé’s use of torn posters in his decollage. All these possible sources are subsumed into the painting; there is no citation, irony, or nostalgia, only the present tense of the painting, with the whitish rectangle framed on the top edge and part of both sides by two tawny bands of color.</p>
<p>A stack of evenly spaced linear pencil lines descends diagonally across the surface of the “raw canvas,” echoing the tilted orientation of the longest turquoise band, which cuts across the painting’s upper right hand corner, “affixing” it to the ground (or what can be read as wall) beneath. The pencil lines suggest that the framed “unpainted” rectangle can be covered further, that this finished painting is not quite “finished.” It occurs me to that “Flush Arch” can be read as Miller’s response to provisional painting, as if to assert that one can be lyrical rather than literal about the makeshift, because that kind of obvious thinking is a continuation of Frank Stella’s “What you see is what you see.” Such thoughts and actions are authoritarian; they deny the viewer’s imagination.</p>

<p>There is instability running through Miller’s work. What do I see beneath the coat of white painting that takes up the middle third of “Scratch Arch” (2015)? Seeing, the artist reminds us, is not all of a piece; it can be incremental and constantly shifting. We must disassemble the transitional state that Miller puts in front of us, focus on the parts and layers, and see how they contribute to the whole, while maintaining their individual identities. Everything in the painting is contingent, but never in any obvious way. Looking becomes archaeological, we begin uncovering the artist’s decisions, finding where she once laid a piece of tape, pulled it up, but then covered over the bare spot and surrounding area with another layer of painting, leaving the ridges as a trace. Seeing becomes a way of tracking one’s thoughts, of trying to determine how the painting came into being.</p>
<p>The paintings are complimented by two sets of sixteen individually numbered drawings titled “Doubles” (all 2015). Each set is installed on adjacent walls, eight to a side. In the drawings, Miller often cuts and peels back a similar pair of geometric shapes, drawing and painting on the obverse side. This doubling makes the gesture of cutting less precious, more part of a system, though what that scheme might be is never clear. It seems to me that Miller’s drawings are a way to accumulate a vocabulary of abstract shapes and marks.</p>

<p>When I mentioned that Miller’s work is like a tiny piece of steel, I did not want to suggest that she was being heroic. Rather, I was advancing that she was being quietly subversive, just as Thomas Nozkowski had been in the late 1970s, when he began painting on prepared canvas board measuring 16 by 20 inches. For a long time the art world did not notice what Nozkowski was up to, because it was too busy celebrating the Neo-Expressionists and their achievement in the market place. Now, thirty-five years later, it is evident that painters such as Eric Fischl and Julian Schnabel are period artists, stuck in their time, just as Jim Dine is stuck in an earlier period. Instead, it’s when artists who keep moving that they attain staying power. Miller is one of those artists. I will gladly cross the street to see her work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-270102" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bowie_blackstar.jpg" alt="bowie_blackstar" width="640" height="640" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bowie_blackstar-180x180.jpg 180w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bowie_blackstar.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>David Bowie was a legendary art hero, a hot tramp and an honorary young American and a true somebody person. He was a gifted actor who injected every role he played with flamboyant electricity, and he was always playing a role. He invented glam-rock and New Romanticism; he mimicked plastic soul and, more recently, plastic jazz; he pioneered a flexible, everlasting art-rock style that swallowed up any genre that dared to develop in its wake. He produced and tampered with albums by Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, and Mott the Hoople; he subjected his own music to healthy tampering by Brian Eno and Nile Rodgers; he’s perhaps the only musician ever to have gotten ripped off by James Brown rather than vice versa; in the hip-hop era, Public Enemy, Ice Cube, and Vanilla Ice all sampled him. He timed the release of his new album, <i>Blackstar</i>, to his impending death from liver cancer, an illness he kept secret until the end — he was already receiving plenty of media attention for the release of <i>Blackstar</i>, by several accounts his best album since who knows when, and when he passed away three days later it was clear the album was intended as a parting gift to his fans. Who else but David Bowie would turn his own death into one final art project? And who but Bowie would do so in a way that wasn’t at all tasteless but generous and beautiful? Watch that man, oh honey watch that man.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom on Bowie stresses his unpredictability, his inconstancy. A “chameleon,” he’s called, and indeed, especially in the ‘70s but really throughout his whole career, he was always changing up his act. Now he’s a new wave pinup idol, now he’s a glittery, androgynous sex panther, now he’s a weirdly conventional and hence utterly outrageous Philadelphia soul man. What’s more, these various musical reinventions went along with corresponding fantastical characters for Bowie to inhabit (with backstories, too!): the Laughing Gnome, the Man Who Sold the World, the Starman and/or Ziggy Stardust (whom Bowie casually murdered in “Rock &amp; Roll Suicide”), Aladdin Sane, the Jean Genie, the Thin White Duke, Jareth the Goblin King (technically, Jareth is a film role, from 1986’s <i>Labyrinth</i>, which even more than 1976’s iconic <i>The Man Who Fell to Earth </i>or 1983’s Catherine Deneuve feature <i>The Hunger </i>stands as Bowie’s absolute triumph as an actor). Thus did Bowie pay tribute to entertainment itself while giving ideas like authenticity and expressionism the finger — by assuming mask after mask, style after style, he implicitly argued that all was performance, that everybody projects some sort of persona, that artifice is beautiful. That’s why he made such a convincing presence onscreen, and why the hagiography that inevitably follows a major celebrity death misses the point, as does any sort of biography, really: not only is our knowledge of Bowie the human being limited and unverified (just try tallying all the times his interviews contradict each other), it’s totally irrelevant. Bowie’s not a human being! He’s a scary monster, he’s a super creep, he’s a Martian, he’s the Mule. Anybody fixated on the “real” “David Bowie” is making certain assumptions about the consistency, validity, and existence of the internal self — assumptions that Bowie made it his mission to obliterate.</p>
<div id="attachment_270103" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bowie_labyrinth.jpg"><img class="wp-image-270103" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bowie_labyrinth.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="488" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bowie_labyrinth-118x180.jpg 118w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bowie_labyrinth-768x1172.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bowie_labyrinth-671x1024.jpg 671w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bowie_labyrinth.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The poster for &#8220;Labyrinth&#8221; (1986) (via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(film)#/media/File:Labyrinth_ver2.jpg">Wikipedia</a>) (click to enlarge)</p></div>
<p>That said, there were unifying factors to his long, messy discography, not least among them his commitment to rock &amp; roll. In the ‘70s he shifted around enough that it made sense to accuse him of musical disinterest, that there was good reason to doubt his credentials as a musician (rather than an artist whose medium happened to be music); in retrospect it’s clear that, in fact, very few of his contemporaries rocked out so compellingly, or so weirdly, or for so long. Some of Bowie’s poses were more brilliant than others, and several of his albums qualified as abject failures. But every one of his brazen triumphs mined variations on the same twisted, crunchy hard-rock style, a sharp, somewhat automated, immediate yet distanced yet hence even-more-immediate guitar crackle perfected on 1973’s brutally tough <i>Aladdin Sane.</i> Check the ferocious bluesy riffage powering “Cracked Actor,” the golden sparkly stomp casting confetti all over “Suffragette City,” even the circular funk guitar providing “Sound and Vision” with a melodic center — there’s no mistaking that relentless punch, that clinical expertise, that unparalleled balance between the two. Even at his most conventional, when he was most recognizable as “rock” (as on <i>Aladdin Sane</i>, 1980’s <i>Scary Monsters</i>, etc.) there’s something cold, something alienated about the very sound of the music, a flatness to the thrash, a deadpan affectlessness to the groove, a determination to just play the hooks and/or go through the motions. Rather than dulling the rock &amp; roll, this mechanized approach somehow jacks up the energy to an unbelievable degree, so that the end result goes bang pop pow boom without canceling out its detached, hypnotic qualities. Add to this a choked, fiery, glittery guitar sound and you have the makings of a musical signature that, no matter how abused or bastardized it wound up after endless reconfigurations, somehow seemed to fit nearly every costume Bowie tried on.</p>
<p>There was one other thing every Bowie album had in common, and that was that they all featured the vocals of David Bowie, which Bowie lovers downplay, Bowie haters highlight, and I view as a strength. Quite simply, the man could not sing. He couldn’t project, sometimes he couldn’t even hit the expected notes, and although both Morrissey and Simon Le Bon are unimaginable without him, Bowie’s instrument is considerably ghastlier than either. On most of his upbeat rockers the melodies were simple enough that it didn’t matter, but even so his voice was pinched, its exaggerated Britishisms ugly rather than refined; when he thought it amusing to sing lounged-up torch songs, when he decided to croon like a French chanteur, when he slowed down the beat for any reason at all, the resulting gasps and screeches turned genuinely painful. And where Morrissey’s piercing, taut, equally painful voice served to express personal pain and speak for anybody (specifically misfit and likely gay adolescents, but really anybody) experiencing similar pain, Bowie couldn’t even manage that, perhaps because misfit adolescence was never his thing, perhaps because his tonsils permitted him even less expressive range. Yet although he switched personas too often to become a spokesman for any one fanbase/demographic, there are consistent, recognizable attributes to his voice that suggest the existence of a metapersona, one outrageous David Bowie character whose numerous changes were possibly more superficial than they appear. Definitely his voice sounds English, definitely it sounds arty, definitely it sounds campy and glamorous and sophisticated. So while Bowie’s audience includes legions of cerebral aesthetes more than happy to debate the pros and cons of his many incarnations, sundry media obsessives who value Bowie mainly for abstract intellectual reasons, I suspect that most Bowie fans respond initially and most keenly to the sound of his singing. Moreover, this is precisely due to everything that makes him a conventionally bad singer. Through his thin, strained harshness he’s simultaneously an average guy and the very model of a worldly English gentleman. Through his flat amateurishness he sounds like no one else on the planet, no matter how many imitators he inspired.</p>
<p>So as I get to know <i>Blackstar</i> in the coming weeks, I’ll also be playing my sentimental favorites, including but not limited to: 1983’s bestselling Nile Rodgers collaboration <i>Let’s Dance</i>, which masqueraded as a bland embrace of straight chart pop only to reveal such a move as his trickiest mask of all; 1973’s relatively underrated <i>Aladdin Sane</i>, which celebrates the aggression of Stonesy blues-rock while subverting that same aggression with sexual insecurity more gauche and fraught than anything Mick Jagger would ever admit to; and 1976’s mind-boggling <i>Station to Station</i>, the ultimate Bowie masterpiece: six long, spacey epics in which he crosses liquid funk with harsh protopunk so as to produce a cross-racial, polyrhythmic genre amalgam the likes of which nobody had approached before or ever will again, closing with a Johnny Mathis cover. “Wild is the Wind” is exactly the kind of song Bowie had no business singing. A slow, tender, florid love ballad, it nudges a singer toward all sorts of overstatement and mannerism (although Mathis’s original is magical), and boy does Bowie succumb to temptation — he lets his voicebox bleed all over the microphone, inserting all sorts of unnecessary quavers and whispers and melismata, and when the music drops out so he can bellow “Don’t you know you’re life… <i>itself</i>!!” he almost faints from the melodrama. By the end, once the jangly backup has reached peak intensity and he’s wailing his lungs out, somehow he’s turned it all into an utterly gorgeous and affecting vocal performance anyway. Mixing detachment and feeling in unpredictable proportions, daring to sing where an ordinary man with the same level of talent would have kept his mouth shut, leaving it totally unclear when he’s acting and when he’s being genuine, he uncovers astonishing vistas of previously undiscovered emotion.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, David Bowie. One magical moment, such is the stuff from where dreams are woven. One day, though it might as well be someday, you and I will rise up all the way, all because of what you are, the prettiest star.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-270086" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/arca_mutant.png" alt="arca_mutant" width="640" height="640" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/arca_mutant-180x180.png 180w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/arca_mutant.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>A cold, electronic half-keyboard/half-drum machine sputters to life, plucking out an elementary melodic progression, speeding up the rhythm for just a split second each time the chords change. After two rounds of this, there’s a sudden crack and another set of high-pitched drum machines starts rattling along, simultaneously jumpstarting the beat while adding spooky harmonic dissonance. A separate keyboard underlines the melody, putting its own spin on things. Slowly a large, glistening sonic machine rises from the ground up — walls on walls of stainless steel, whirring blades in one corner, with giant gears interlocking, sparks flying, in another. The thing pauses for a moment, wobbles back and forth, uncertain, on the verge of crashing to the ground. Suddenly there’s a ripple in the drum machine (or is that a jackhammer explosion?), and it all starts up again. And so it goes all throughout <i>Mutant</i>, the new album from Arca.</p>
<p>Arca is a pseudonym for Alejandro Ghersi, a Venezuelan DJ/producer based in New York. He specializes in eerie, glitchy, electronic instrumentals that confound ordinary electronica categories — “trance” doesn’t really fit no matter how relaxing one might find the music; neither does “industrial” no matter how vividly the music evokes big metal objects and factory conveyor belts; “EDM” belongs to a different universe entirely — and, once you’ve bonded with said instrumentals (which can take a while), they confound ordinary habits of listening, too. Ghersi was a guest producer on Björk’s <i>Vulnicura</i>, FKA Twigs’s <i>LP1</i>, and Kanye West’s <i>Yeezus</i>, but <i>Mutant</i>, out since November, is more formally imaginative than any of them. Expanding and elaborating on the winning style he invented with <i>Xen</i>, his 2014 debut, <i>Mutant </i>scrunches itself into surprising sonic shapes and bright, gummy colors unfamiliar to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Played in the background, the album will probably prove way too loud, intrusive, engaging; sit down to concentrate on it and you’ll likely wish you’d played it in the background instead. But once you’ve played it X number of times, often enough to have absorbed its various twists and turns, I swear it all coheres in a flash, upon which you’ll be happy to wander its virtual maze. Like the roughly comparable beatmaster Clams Casino’s assorted instrumental mixtapes, <i>Mutant </i>fits the soundscape genre in form but not in feel. It stretches out for just over an hour with nary a human voice to be heard, true, but it altogether lacks the sleepy luxury of, say, Boards of Canada (or for that matter, the neoclassical austerity of, say, Aphex Twin) — it’s too beat-driven; its massive synthesizer whomp would alarm the occupants of any lounge or concert hall. The basic trick of soundscape is to cultivate cool electronic surface while (primarily through melody, but also samples and the like) creating a warm, tender, oddly intimate emotional tone, thus discovering soul in the machine. Arca’s music refuses to comply. Rather, it creaks and scrapes, scratches and crunches, with textures that tend toward the sharp/metallic/screeching and melodies that tend toward the dour. If, as tradition requires in Arca’s genre, he means to create a musical world, that world is an abrasive one, depersonalized and alien, filled with too many machines with too many moving parts, too many rotating knives and spinning wheels and vacuum tubes. Yet this machine does possess its own depraved version of soul, a soul that comes out not through nice tunes or reassuring lyrics but through the deep pleasures of hearing its pitched drum machines and polished keyboards zap and buzz and beep and jitter and invert on themselves, and recognizing that these cool noises proceed from an irrepressible sense of play. Constantly slipping from one rhythm to another, slinking around in patterns known only to the gears grinding away underneath, he always keeps you on your toes. “Many of [<i>Mutant</i>’s] 20 tracks flow together almost imperceptibly, one song springing out of the tail end of another like taffy being pulled,” <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9754-arcas-warped-beauty/" target="_blank">wrote</a> Philip Sherburne in <i>Pitchfork</i>, and that does justice to Arca’s peculiar style of motion.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-270090" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/arca_xen.jpg" alt="arca_xen" width="640" height="640" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/arca_xen-180x180.jpg 180w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/arca_xen.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Spiraling out of control, spiraling back into control, breaking down and shattering only to magically reform into a different steel contraption entirely, <i>Mutant </i>is the rare album you can get lost in without falling asleep. Its energy, perversity, and taste for big, percussive, tangible textures distinguish it from innumerable contemporary classical chefs-d’oeuvre and/or adventures into laptoptronica, and its taste for melodies that like to hide behind big iron sculptures, revealing themselves only to repeat listeners, ensures that you’ll keep coming back for more. “Snakes” sways back and forth to the haunting lullaby of a high keyboard imitating some variety of stringed instrument, possibly a mock electronic harp, as well-timed grates and jerks echo around in the background, throwing the main instrument off balance. “Vanity” sends its lead synthesizer through a cascading array of filters — first it’s sharp and clear, then it’s blunt and watery, with bubbles floating through, then it topples over, sends the textural roulette wheel spinning, and settles on sharp and clear again — all while embedding little bleeps and flutters and chirps behind the main register, tripping up the rhythm and adding an extra unexpected dimension of harmony. “Sever” conjures up an imaginary harpsichord where the keys pluck wires instead of strings, repeating a simple, dissonant melody for two minutes of glorious key-pounding broken up by a popped bass interlude. But to focus on individual tracks does a disservice to the sheer totality of the album; everything is always morphing into something else, and no matter how many little fragments make up the whole, <i>Mutant </i>makes itself felt as a single slab of concrete sound. I like it when music comes in discrete parts, and believe strongly that one should be able to differentiate one puzzle piece from another. But with <i>Mutant </i>that’s beside the point. Put the track listing aside, close your eyes, and you’ll hear one unified if warped, tricky, nervous, and very beautiful musical entity.</p>
<p>Relentlessly inventive, amusingly neurotic, <i>Mutant</i> may qualify as the harshest chillout environment and the most relaxing barrage of industrial noise any avant-tinkerer has ever dared. Play it over dinner, especially if your guests feel conflicted about modern technology. Play it over headphones, walking aimlessly through the city, staring at skyscrapers and your own reflection. Play it any time you crave a jolt or a blat or a sizzle.</p>

<p>The whirlwind of performances accompanying the annual convention of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters in New York has come to a close, with PS122&#8217;s COIL, the Public Theater&#8217;s Under the Radar, HERE&#8217;s Prototype, Abrons Arts Center&#8217;s American Realness, and other festivals wrapping up last Sunday. Some of the performances turned for inspiration to darkness, both figuratively and literally.</p>
<p>Full of ideas, many of them disturbing, <em><a href="http://www.ps122.org/confirmation/">Confirmation</a></em>, presented at the Invisible Dog Art Center in Brooklyn as part of COIL, explores territory foreign to the festivals&#8217; often sympathetic, identity-affirming tenor. <em>Confirmation</em> is based on interviews conducted by the Manchester-based performer Chris Thorpe with &#8220;Glen,&#8221; a British right-wing activist. The piece explores the &#8220;confirmation bias,&#8221; a general tendency for humans to interpret facts in such a way as to confirm existing beliefs, a phenomenon that affects, for example, scientific studies, as researchers misinterpret or overlook contrary data.</p>
<p>Thorpe and co-developer and director Rachel Chavkin have created a one-person show for Thorpe, in which he plays himself and impersonates Glen. The staging could hardly be pared down further. The set is a couple of chairs. Thorpe sometimes uses a microphone, but often relies upon his unaided voice to reach the audience, who are seated close by on all four sides and whom he regularly addresses directly. Early on, he makes a costume change into Glen, who presents himself plainly in a white, collared, short-sleeve shirt and gray trousers. Glen explains that Thorpe would react negatively to the way he usually dresses, and so he has chosen this neutral costume to get the best reception. Glen is, by the way, an avowed Nazi.</p>
<p>At some moments, it was unclear which character was speaking. Thorpe remained dressed as Glen even when he switched back to playing himself. Though there may have been clues discernible to British ears, it seemed as if Thorpe spoke in the same accent as both himself and Glen. This confusion might have been deliberate, to show the transference of identity as the conversations continued, but it blunted the ideological conflict driving the show.</p>
<p>As himself, Thorpe reassures the spectators about his own progressive values and explains that he deliberately sought out his opposite as a way of testing and strengthening his own beliefs. What he found was more complex than he expected. Glen is a Holocaust-denying racist, of course, but he reveals his soft side to Thorpe and evolves over the course of their talks. Although Glen&#8217;s opinions are repulsive, he shows intelligence in his efforts to persuade Thorpe, who confesses to being partly swayed by his interlocutor. <em>Confirmation</em> succeeds in offering an unsensational, unsentimental look into the world of white suprematists in the U.K. and by extension their likeminded cohorts in the U.S., an uncomfortable but necessary experience. As Sun-Tzu advised in <em>The Art of War</em>, know your enemy.</p>
<div id="attachment_270126" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270126" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The_Art_of_LUV_1-ROKE_5642R.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The_Art_of_LUV_1-ROKE_5642R-270x180.jpg 270w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The_Art_of_LUV_1-ROKE_5642R-768x512.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The_Art_of_LUV_1-ROKE_5642R-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The_Art_of_LUV_1-ROKE_5642R.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A scene from &#8220;The Art of Luv (Part 1): Elliot&#8221; (photo by Maria Baranova)</p></div>
<p>With its use of a repellant antihero, <em>Confirmation</em> resembled <em><a href="http://www.publictheater.org/Tickets/Calendar/PlayDetailsCollection/UTR/2016/Art-of-Luv/">The Art of Luv (Part 1): Elliot</a> </em>at the Public Theater&#8217;s Under the Radar Festival. Royal Osiris Karaoke Ensemble, like Chavkin and Thorne, turns to a bigot for its story. Though the piece has many modules, the central thread concerns Elliot Rodger, who went on a shooting spree at his California college in 2014 because he felt rejected by women. The piece includes videos that Rodger, deluded and pitiful, posted before the killings, in which he, the supreme narcissist, insists on how &#8220;magnificent&#8221; he is and wonders how women could turn him down. As with the other sampled video in the show, Royal Osiris Karaoke Ensemble lip-syncs Rodger&#8217;s video monologue and then gradually actually speaks his words as Rodger&#8217;s voice is muted. Duplicate video streams of the lip-syncing performer are projected overhead on either side of Rodger&#8217;s video, as in an oversized triptych.</p>
<p>Unlike Chavkin and Thorpe, ROKE approaches Rodger&#8217;s twisted worldview with irony, contextualizing it within America&#8217;s vapid consumer culture. ROKE incorporates a teen&#8217;s homemade shopping review videos and vintage how-to-get-a-girl instructional films to evoke the society that created Rodger and made him feel like a failure.</p>
<p>Audience members had the choice to sit in regular theater seats or on cushions on the floor, like devotees in the presence of their guru. Sitting cross-legged on a slightly elevated platform, the ROKE performers wore white kimonos and gold wreathes in their hair, and their faces were painted gold. The framing device for the piece as a whole was an unlikely meditation exercise, complete with the familiar breathing instructions of a yoga class. <em>Luv</em> is a tongue-in-cheek healing ritual for the age of mass murder. Like <em>Confirmation</em>, <em>Luv</em> theatrically contrasts extreme hatred and soft liberalism, here the yogic, laissez-faire, nonjudgmental ethos of California. ROKE&#8217;s comic, playfully appropriationist approach offers a look at evil that is no less disturbing.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.ps122.org/morphia-series/">Morphia Series</a></em>, by choreographer Helen Herbertson and lighting designer Ben Cobham, part of COIL and performed in shifts before a small audience of twelve at the Baryshnikov Arts Center, is wonderfully brief (twenty minutes). The brevity is especially welcome in the festival context, when many APAP visitors and New York performance-lovers have already perhaps seen too much. Cobham has designed the theater experience extremely well: a backlit box for Herbertson to dance in and movable audience seating.</p>
<div id="attachment_270128" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270128" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/unspecified.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/unspecified-270x180.jpg 270w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/unspecified-768x512.jpg 768w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/unspecified-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/unspecified.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A scene from &#8220;Morphia Series&#8221; (photo by Maria Baranova)</p></div>
<p>The audience is ushered two at a time into the noiseless Howard Gilman Theater at BAC and is allowed some time for the eyes to adjust to the cave-like lack of illumination. It is so dark that one wonders whether the fire marshal knew about this set-up. Eventually, Cobham&#8217;s box starts to glow, and stage smoke circulates inside the box, forming a cloud around Herbertson&#8217;s body. She dances mostly with her arms, understandably since there&#8217;s not much room in the box to leap around. The stage picture is captivating. The piece achieves a Cageian openness to the accidental present, in which attention is heightened by exclusion, the work of darkness and soundproofing. A smart, short, intimate performance could become a powerful experience. But the show doesn&#8217;t push hard enough to turn its visual and acoustic success into something more, whether emotional response or intellectual awakening. The soundtrack is too often unsurprising: nature sounds (birds chirping) and some street noise, though some of that might have snuck in from West 37th Street. A recorded female voice recites some lines about “her,&#8221; presumably the woman in the box. &#8220;Her&#8221; feelings are described, though not who she is or where she is or why she feels that way. &#8220;She&#8221; could be anyone, which might be the point, but the generality robs the performance of the chance to add substance and depth to the engaging visual experience that Herbertson and Cobham have devised.</p>
<p>At the end — spoiler alert! — the movable seating brings the audience in for a sudden close-up encounter with Herbertson&#8217;s aging body. Plenty of dances today, however, purposely feature persons of different ages, (dis-)abilities and sizes, and in 2016 the visual experience of the naked female performer of any age is considerably less shocking and provocative to thought than it was when feminist art performance began in the U.S. in the 1960s.</p>

<p>To be clear, Jeff Schwarz doesn’t use paint on his ceramic paintings. The marks, swipes, smears, and sprays across his surprisingly versatile surfaces are created entirely with glaze, slip, and clay. While that technical distinction may seem beside the point as you puzzle over his intimate distillations of the urban environment, the difference is not academic.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="http://www.outletbk.com/exhibitions/jeff-schwarz-stacks" target="_blank">STACKS</a></i>, his striking new show at Outlet Fine Art in Bushwick, Schwarz presents two basic shapes, the cylindrical “Stack” (as it is called in the artist’s titling system) and the rectangular “Tile.” Most are mid-size (two to three feet in height), though a few are smaller, lined up on a tabletop, and there’s one very large piece standing on the floor. The surfaces are covered with a profligacy of mark-making that seems to splinter, scorch and vaporize the ordinarily impervious surface of clay. Some works even venture into the realm of <i>trompe-l’oeil</i>, with opaque strokes of terra cotta giving way to deep space teeming with ethereal lines.</p>
<div id="attachment_270116" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-270116 size-full" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stack-S_N-2015_7_24.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="571" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Jeff Schwarz, “Stack S/N 2015_7_24” (2015), ceramic, 19 x 12 x 12 inches</p></div>
<p>It matters that the markings are glaze, clay and slip (often pumped from a spray applicator) because the consistency between the pigmentation and the underlying form (clay on clay, rather than paint on clay) imparts an organic unity that the artist subverts to disorienting effect.</p>
<p>The categorical titles “Stack” and “Tile,” which are followed by inventory-like designations such as “S/N 2015_7_24,” relate to the modular structure that’s implied in some works and literal in others. The cylindrical modules are stacked most dramatically in “Stack S/N 2015_12_23” (2015), the seven-and-a-half-foot-tall showstopper dominating Outlet’s front room. Its title and stovepipe form evoke the smokestacks emblematic of America’s past industrial might, while the graffiti-like lines covering its surface suggest the abandonment of such Rust Belt cities as Braddock, Detroit, and Flint.</p>
<p>But that reading goes only so far. The markings in Schwarz’s work, while invoking the spirit of graffiti, never venture into mimicry. The lines are too attenuated and too resolutely abstract, trailing up and down the length of the form without coalescing into a word or image. The result is a streetwise lyricism echoing with the Beat rhythms of AbEx, the Diamond Dog days of New York’s ‘70s slide, and the raw fabric of the city just beyond the current wave of homogenization.</p>
<div id="attachment_270115" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-270115 size-full" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stack-S_N-2015_12_23.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="570" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stack-S_N-2015_12_23-101x180.jpg 101w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stack-S_N-2015_12_23.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Jeff Schwarz, “Stack S/N 2015_12_23,” (2015), ceramic, 91 x 28 1⁄2 x 31 1⁄2 inches</p></div>
<p>The surface of “Stack S/N 2015_12_23” is composed of three distinct layers: a top coat of lines snaking across the entire form; a hard-edged, opaque skin; and areas that seem to open into deep space, where dozens of translucent lines writhe and converge.</p>
<p>The effect isn’t that of a palimpsest, where the overlays indicate a history of afterthoughts and erasures. Rather, the determining concept seems to be a structured improvisation proceeding from a purposefully restricted visual vocabulary.</p>
<p>Schwarz kicks his circumscribed choices into an array of formally imaginative variations: colors that bleed from green to rust with the sweet slickness of graffiti fill (“Stack S/N 2015_5_25,” 2015); rectangles cut through cylinder walls to create literal, rather than simulated, windows into space (“Stack S/N 2015_7_24,” “Stack S/N 2015_4_30,” both 2015); swooping, expressionistic brushstrokes that dissolve the terra cotta plane like a coat of Zip-Strip, revealing faintly glowing streaks in the far distance (“Tile S/N 2015_12_9,” 2015).</p>
<p>Most of the “Stack” sculptures are comprised of a single component despite their apparent openness to additional elements; all of the “Tile” works, however, are sectional in one form or another. Sometimes the adjoining squares and rectangles, such as the ones making up the above-mentioned “Tile S/N 2015_12_9,” are subsumed into the image; elsewhere, as in the mistily colored “Tile S/N 2015_12_9” (2015), the black, linear separations between the parts are so pronounced that they become the overriding design element.</p>
<p>“Tile S/N 2015_12_1_1” and “Tile S/N 2015_12_17” (both 2015) are very different from the other “Tile” paintings in the show, in that their sections are made up of long, vertical strips whose surfaces ripple like corrugated steel. The first of the two takes its cues from the triple-layered surfaces of the “Stacks,&#8221; although the middle stratum is translucent rather than opaque, allowing the black and blue lines squirming beneath to shine through.</p>
<div id="attachment_270117" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-270117 size-full" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/installation-view.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="356" srcset="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/installation-view-291x162.jpg 291w, http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/installation-view.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Installation view of &#8216;Jeff Schwarz | STACKS&#8217; at Outlet Fine Art</p></div>
<p>“Tile S/N 2015_12_17,” however, remains an unyielding surface with no apertures, real or illusionistic, opening into the distance. Its swarm of lines lies on top of the corrugation, slightly corroding its silvery blue patina here and there. The lower third of the piece, as well as the vertical sections to the right, left and center, are blackened as if they’d been doused in gasoline and set aflame.</p>
<p>This piece, with its associations to shantytowns, urban decay, civil unrest, and armed conflict, forces a second look at the other works in the show and the implied violence of their jagged streaks and empty windows. Schwarz’s combinatory and contradictory practice squeezes the hard nut of reality through a formal filter that transforms a familiar device, the graffiti tag, into a form of pure abstraction wrapped in historically aware quotation marks.</p>
<div id="attachment_270119" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-270119 size-full" src="http://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tile-S_N-2015_12_9.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="504" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Jeff Schwarz, “Tile S/N 2015_12_9” (2015), ceramic, 39 x 24 inches</p></div>
<p>The slashes and splashes feel qualitatively different from those employed by expressionist painters past and present. Their translation into pigmented clay makes it impossible to look at them without sensing a material distance from the feverishly reworked surfaces that such markings imply. They are not so much exposed as tropes, in a neo-conceptual sense, as they are engaged as signs evidencing how much of the past has been absorbed into the present.</p>
<p>Schwarz’s sculptures, despite their intimations of vanished epochs and banished grittiness, succumb neither to nostalgia nor urban chic. They remain firmly in the apocalyptic now, at once self-contained and, in their actual or implied modality, inherently unstable, harboring the potential for random rearrangements.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s this duality, this instability, that feels so centered about them, as paradoxical as that is to say. Rock-solid yet melting into air, if they bestow any certainty at all, it’s the inescapable capriciousness of fate.</p>
